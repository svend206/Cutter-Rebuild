# MVP Plan — Current State to Locked MVP

This plan enumerates the work required to move from the current, evidenced state to the locked MVP capability definition. It is derived from the gap analysis and the five reports, and is organized by MVP capability gaps only.

---

## Scope

Gaps requiring work (from current evidence):
- (none)

Completed gaps:
- MVP-8 — Explicit, downstream-only Guild exhaust export
- MVP-10 — Absence of action is a preserved, inspectable fact
- MVP-6 — Evidence may be referenced but never evaluated
- MVP-5 — State continuity requires explicit reaffirmation

Already implemented and out of scope:
- MVP-1, MVP-2, MVP-3, MVP-4, MVP-7, MVP-9, MVP-11

---

## Workstreams and Deliverables

---

## Evidence Update Protocol

For each workstream:
- Implement capability changes.
- Update test coverage to demonstrate the success conditions.
- Refresh reports 1–4 with direct file/test evidence.
- Update MVP Gap Analysis status accordingly.
