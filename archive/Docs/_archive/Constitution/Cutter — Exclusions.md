Cutter — Exclusions
Purpose

This document defines what Cutter explicitly excludes.

These exclusions are not missing features.
They are protective constraints.

Cutter’s value depends on refusing capabilities that would convert operational reality into interpretation, reassurance, or prescription.

Any implementation that violates these exclusions is not Cutter.

Exclusion Principle

Cutter excludes anything that:

substitutes judgment for evidence

converts persistence into narrative

smooths variance into comfort

reframes operational facts as advice

reduces epistemic discomfort

enables continued operation without accumulating consequence

Cutter exists to preserve epistemic friction.

Excluded Functions

Cutter does not include:

recommendations

optimization suggestions

prioritization logic

“next best action” prompts

alerts framed as urgency

health indicators

performance ratings

benchmarks framed as goals

root-cause analysis

All of these embed judgment.

Excluded System Roles

Cutter is not:

an ERP

a workflow manager

a scheduling engine

a productivity tool

a coaching system

a decision support system

an analytics platform

Those systems intervene in behavior.

Cutter only records consequence.

Excluded Language

Cutter does not use language that implies:

success or failure

improvement or decline

safety or danger

urgency or reassurance

blame or praise

compliance or deviation

All language must remain descriptive, temporal, and factual.

Excluded Data Transformations

Cutter does not:

normalize variance

average away tails

collapse persistence into scores that erase duration

retroactively reinterpret historical data

reweight history based on new context

History remains intact.

Excluded Emotional Functions

Cutter does not attempt to:

motivate

align

reassure

inspire confidence

reduce anxiety

soften discomfort

Discomfort is a signal.

Removing it recreates epistemic failure.

Excluded Usage Patterns

Cutter is not to be used for:

employee evaluation

performance management

compensation decisions

disciplinary processes

compliance reporting

customer justification

vendor negotiation scripts

Using Cutter for leverage corrupts its epistemic role.

Excluded Visual Patterns

Cutter does not use:

traffic-light color schemes

gamification

progress bars framed as success

“at a glance” health summaries

celebratory or warning iconography

Visual design must resist emotional inference.

Relationship to Optimization Systems

Optimization systems may coexist with Cutter.

They may consume Cutter’s records.

They must not:

overwrite them

reinterpret them

collapse them into advice

feed conclusions back into the ledger

Cutter remains upstream of optimization.

Why Exclusion Is Essential

Every excluded feature makes Cutter:

easier to adopt

more familiar

more comfortable

Comfort delays recognition.

Cutter exists to prevent recognition from being delayed.

Closing Statement

Cutter protects value not by being powerful,

but by being narrow.

If Cutter ever becomes helpful in moments of avoidance,
it has already failed.
