Cutter — System Refusals
Purpose

This document defines behaviors, requests, and conditions that Cutter will explicitly refuse.

Refusal is not a limitation.
Refusal is Cutter’s primary defense against epistemic corruption.

Any implementation that complies with the refused behaviors defined here is not Cutter.

Refusal Principle

Cutter refuses any interaction that would allow operational reality to be:

softened

negotiated

overwritten

explained away

optimized prematurely

forgotten

The system must remain inhospitable to epistemic compromise.

Canonical Refusals
R1. Refusal of Retrospective Editing

Cutter refuses edits to past operational records.

Once work has demonstrated something, that demonstration stands.

Corrections must take the form of new records, not revisions.

R2. Refusal of Narrative Substitution

Cutter refuses free-form explanation fields tied to operational events.

Explanations do not alter demonstrated reality.

Narrative belongs outside the ledger.

R3. Refusal of Silent Normalization

Cutter refuses to treat repetition as resolution.

Repeated variance does not become baseline by familiarity alone.

Persistence must remain visible until displaced by contrary evidence.

R4. Refusal of Judgment Encoding

Cutter refuses labels, scores, or states that imply:

good or bad

healthy or unhealthy

acceptable or unacceptable

safe or risky

Judgment is not a data type.

R5. Refusal of Optimization Pressure

Cutter refuses to:

suggest improvements

rank alternatives

surface “top issues”

identify bottlenecks for action

Optimization converts evidence into advice.

Advice delays recognition.

R6. Refusal of Alerting as Urgency

Cutter refuses alerts framed as:

warnings

emergencies

escalation triggers

Time and persistence are sufficient signals.

Urgency language reintroduces interpretation.

R7. Refusal of Role-Based Interpretation

Cutter refuses views that reinterpret operational reality based on role, seniority, or audience.

The owner, operator, and observer see the same facts.

Authority changes responsibility, not truth.

R8. Refusal of Performance Attribution

Cutter refuses to attribute variance to individuals.

It records what happened, not who is at fault.

Using Cutter to assign blame invalidates the ledger.

R9. Refusal of Outcome Framing

Cutter refuses to frame records in terms of outcomes achieved or missed.

Outcomes invite post-hoc justification.

Cutter records only demonstration and persistence.

R10. Refusal of Comfort

Cutter refuses features designed to:

reassure

calm

motivate

encourage

affirm

Discomfort is not a UX flaw.

It is an epistemic signal.

Escalation Through Refusal

When Cutter refuses an interaction:

no workaround is offered

no alternative path is suggested

no override exists

The refusal itself is the forcing function.

Relationship to Authority

Cutter does not enforce authority.

It assumes authority exists.

When authority attempts to evade operational reality, Cutter refuses cooperation.

Why Refusal Is Essential

Most operational epistemic failure occurs not through ignorance,

but through systems that accommodate avoidance.

Cutter exists to remove that accommodation.

Closing Statement

Cutter preserves truth by refusing to make it easier.

If the system ever cooperates in moments of avoidance,
it has already failed.
