Cutter ↔ State Vault — Boundary & Symmetry
Purpose

This document defines the formal relationship between Cutter and State Vault.

It exists to prevent role confusion, epistemic leakage, and future erosion of constraints.

Cutter and State Vault may coexist.
They may inform one another.
They may never substitute for one another.

Any implementation that blurs this boundary compromises both systems.

Shared Ethical Foundation

Cutter and State Vault are governed by the same ethical claim:

Authority does not need advice.
Authority needs reality that survives time, pressure, and explanation.

Both systems exist to prevent epistemic failure in high-downside environments.

They differ only in what layer of reality they bind.

Layer of Binding
State Vault — Declarative Epistemic Ledger

State Vault records:

what authority declared to be true

when it was declared

who owned that recognition

how long it persisted

State Vault binds recognized reality.

It answers:

“What did we say was true?”

“How long did we proceed under that declaration?”

Cutter — Operational Epistemic Ledger

Cutter records:

what operations demonstrated

when it was demonstrated

how often it repeated

how long it persisted

Cutter binds demonstrated reality.

It answers:

“What did the work show?”

“How long has this been true?”

Symmetry of Structure
Dimension	State Vault	Cutter
Domain	Organizational state	Operational work
Input	Explicit declaration	Measured demonstration
Memory	Append-only	Append-only
Time	Time-in-state	Time-in-variance
Judgment	Excluded	Excluded
Prescription	Excluded	Excluded
Optimization	Excluded	Excluded
Authority	Assumed	Assumed
Function	Recognition	Evidence

Neither system explains.
Neither system advises.
Neither system reassures.

Explicit Boundary Conditions
B1. No Substitution

Cutter may not:

declare organizational state

classify health or stability

stand in for recognition

State Vault may not:

infer operational reality

substitute for measured work

interpret performance

Each binds only its own layer.

B2. No Feedback Loops That Collapse Judgment

Cutter data may be viewed alongside State Vault records.

It may not:

auto-trigger state declarations

auto-reclassify entities

force recognition

Recognition remains a human act.

B3. No Interpretive Mediation

Neither system may:

summarize the other into conclusions

translate records into recommendations

collapse evidence into advice

Any synthesis must occur outside both ledgers.

B4. Independence of Failure

Either system may be correct while the other is wrong.

Examples:

Leadership may declare stability while operations drift.

Operations may appear stable while leadership delays recognition.

This tension is not a bug.

It is the signal.

Permitted Adjacency

Cutter and State Vault may:

share identity primitives (entities, time, ownership)

coexist in the same environment

be reviewed together by authority

They may not:

merge data models

collapse records

override one another

Adjacency is permitted.
Dependency is not.

Irreversibility Protection

The combined system exists to make irreversible thresholds crossed consciously rather than accidentally.

State Vault prevents silent continuation of belief.

Cutter prevents silent continuation of drift.

Together, they close the loop that allows:

explanation to replace evidence

patience to become commitment

normal to become irreversible

Canonical Guarantee

If both systems are implemented according to their canons:

reality will persist

time will accumulate

memory will resist revision

authority will face facts early

Failure may still occur.

It will not occur invisibly.

Final Boundary Statement

State Vault ensures that recognition is explicit.
Cutter ensures that evidence is undeniable.

Neither tells you what to do.

They ensure you cannot pretend you did not know.

Closing Statement

When businesses fail late, the damage is not abstract.

It is borne by employees, customers, suppliers, and owners alike.

These systems exist to honor the ethical obligation of authority:

to face reality early enough to choose differently.
