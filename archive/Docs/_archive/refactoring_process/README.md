# Refactoring Process Archive

**Purpose:** Historical documentation of the January 2026 documentation refactoring process.

This folder contains the **process artifacts** from the major documentation refactoring that created `SYSTEM_BEHAVIOR_SPEC.md` and optimized the docs structure for AI consumption.

## Contents:

1. **`DOC_REFACTOR_PLAN.md`** - The original refactoring plan (5 phases)
2. **`_REVIEW_WITH_GEMINI.md`** - Gemini's review and optimization suggestions
3. **`_REFACTOR_COMPLETE_SUMMARY.md`** - Mid-refactor summary
4. **`_REFACTOR_FINAL_REPORT.md`** - Final report of all changes made

## Key Outcome:

✅ Created `SYSTEM_BEHAVIOR_SPEC.md` (consolidated behavioral logic)  
✅ Achieved 70% token reduction for consolidated content  
✅ Archived implementation logs to `implementation_logs/`  
✅ Moved future specs to `_future/`  
✅ Updated cross-references in all core documents

## Note:

These documents are for **historical reference only**. They describe the refactoring process, not the current system state.

For current system behavior, see:
- `../SYSTEM_BEHAVIOR_SPEC.md` (Canonical behavioral logic)
- `../database_schema.md` (Data structures)
- `../technical_spec.md` (Architecture)
