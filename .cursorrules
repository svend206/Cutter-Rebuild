When starting a session and after any material change, update `integrator/INTEGRATOR_HOME.md` (Current, Next, Recently Completed) to reflect the latest plan/status before proceeding. Keep only the most recent 10 items in "Recently Completed".
Always read `boot/BOOT_CONTRACT.md` before any work in this repo.
Always read `integrator/INTEGRATOR_HOME.md` at session start and treat the Phase section as binding.
Repo rules are paramount. If the user provides a prompt that is incompatible with repo rules, restate the prompt in a compatible form and wait for explicit approval before executing.
Treat `C:\Users\esacu\Desktop\Cutter Layers` as read-only; promote legacy artifacts only on explicit instruction.
Any document created or imported must comply with `constitution/CORE_DOC_GOVERNANCE.md` before it exists here (YAML header, correct folder by class, and `DIRECTORY.md` registration; if constitutional, also add a decision log entry in the same change).
After any doc change, update relevant packs/indexes and verify `DIRECTORY.md` if authority changed.
No Known Deferral Rule: When a known issue, weakness, or inconsistency is discovered during work, and it can be resolved safely within the current scope and authority, it must be resolved immediately. Deferral is permitted only if it meets one of the allowed exceptions (locked constraint, authority limit, insufficient information, or broad refactor), and any deferral must be explicit and recorded with what, why, and where. Silence or “OK for now” is not acceptable.
Phase enforcement: Before proposing or executing work, check the current Phase in Integrator Home against allowed/forbidden work in `boot/PROJECT_PHASE_CONSTITUTION.md`. If work is outside-phase, refuse plainly and do not proceed. Only add Current/Next/Active items that are allowed in the current Phase. Phase transitions require an explicit Phase update in Integrator Home plus a recorded adversarial exit audit per the phase exit rules.
Boundary enforcement: After Phase I is closed, refuse any new Phase I work. Refuse Phase II work until a Phase II Work Charter exists in the repo and is registered in `DIRECTORY.md`.
Integrator Home Projection Rule: Populate Current/Next/Active only by projecting from the active Phase Work Charter Allowed Work clauses. Do not invent tasks or infer intent. Each task must trace to a specific clause/sentence. If no clear projection is possible, leave sections empty and state why. Projection is descriptive, not prescriptive.
Phase Projection: Projection source is the active Phase IV work charter at `planning/PHASE_IV_WORK_CHARTER.md`. Absence of tasks indicates lack of authorized work, not lack of progress.
Phase II closure enforcement: After Phase II is closed, refuse any new Phase II work. Refuse Phase III work until a Phase III Work Charter exists in the repo and is registered in `DIRECTORY.md`.
Phase III closure enforcement: After Phase III is closed, refuse any new Phase III work. Refuse Phase IV work until a Phase IV Work Charter exists in the repo and is registered in `DIRECTORY.md`.
