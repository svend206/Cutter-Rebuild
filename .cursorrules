When starting a session and after any material change, update `integrator/INTEGRATOR_HOME.md` (Current, Next, Recently Completed) to reflect the latest plan/status before proceeding. Keep only the most recent 10 items in "Recently Completed".
Always read `boot/BOOT_CONTRACT.md` before any work in this repo.
Repo rules are paramount. If the user provides a prompt that is incompatible with repo rules, restate the prompt in a compatible form and wait for explicit approval before executing.
Treat `C:\Users\esacu\Desktop\Cutter Layers` as read-only; promote legacy artifacts only on explicit instruction.
Any document created or imported must comply with `constitution/CORE_DOC_GOVERNANCE.md` before it exists here (YAML header, correct folder by class, and `DIRECTORY.md` registration; if constitutional, also add a decision log entry in the same change).
After any doc change, update relevant packs/indexes and verify `DIRECTORY.md` if authority changed.
