# Integrator Home

This is the single status surface.

## Phase
- Phase: IV — Exposure
- Phase intent: Surface bound reality to humans without interpretation.
- Phase exit gate: No visual judgment, implied priority, hidden aggregation, or softened persistence.
- Phase IV entry obligations: record volume/obscuring (record flooding); practical human inspectability/accessibility.

Phase rule: Items in Current/Next/Active must be allowed work for the declared phase in `boot/PROJECT_PHASE_CONSTITUTION.md`. Out-of-phase work must be refused and removed from those lists, not deferred.

## Current
- (none)

## Next
- (none)

## Active Tasks
- (none)

## Recently Completed
- Phase III closed (PASS) with adversarial exit audit; REPORT 39 recorded.
- Hardened Phase III binding matrix with explicit deferrals and entry obligations.
- Remediated Phase III binding matrix and recorded REPORT 39.
- Created Phase III binding matrix and registered it in DIRECTORY.
- Created Phase III work charter and registered it in DIRECTORY.
- Phase II closed (PASS) with adversarial exit audit; REPORT 38 recorded.
- De-agentified Phase II work charter language and updated REPORT 35.
- Applied Phase II language-only fixes (record types + invariants) and updated REPORT 35.
- Created Phase II representation invariants and registered it in DIRECTORY.
- Created Phase II record types catalogue and registered it in DIRECTORY.
- Renamed Phase II work charter to `planning/PHASE_II_WORK_CHARTER.md` and updated references.

Notes:
- Keep "Current" capped at 3 items.
- No ideas, backlog, or architecture here.
