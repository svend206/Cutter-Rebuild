# Integrator Home

This is the single status surface.

## Phase
- Phase: V — Reliance (CLOSED)
- Phase intent: Define reliance boundaries without surrendering judgment or responsibility.
- Phase exit gate: No authority creep, implied correctness, or responsibility leakage.
- Phase V adversarial audit: PASS (non-author, Phase V scope).

Phase rule: Items in Current/Next/Active must be allowed work for the declared phase in `boot/PROJECT_PHASE_CONSTITUTION.md`. Out-of-phase work must be refused and removed from those lists, not deferred.

## Current
