# Integrator Home

This is the single status surface.

## Phase
- Phase: X — Exit, Shutdown, and Irreversibility (CLOSED)
- Phase intent: Define exit and irreversibility boundaries without implied closure.
- Phase exit gate: Stopping this system does not hide, revise, or soften reality.

Phase rule: Items in Current/Next/Active must be allowed work for the declared phase in `boot/PROJECT_PHASE_CONSTITUTION.md`. Out-of-phase work must be refused and removed from those lists, not deferred.
