# Integrator Home

This is the single status surface.

## Phase
- Phase: VII — Guarantees & Claim Boundaries (CLOSED)
- Phase intent: Define explicit guarantees, denials, and refusal binding.
- Phase exit gate: Every considered claim is guaranteed, denied, or out of scope.

Phase rule: Items in Current/Next/Active must be allowed work for the declared phase in `boot/PROJECT_PHASE_CONSTITUTION.md`. Out-of-phase work must be refused and removed from those lists, not deferred.

## Current
- (none)

## Next
- (none)

## Active Tasks
- (none)
