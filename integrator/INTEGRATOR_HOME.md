# Integrator Home

This is the single status surface.

## Phase
- Phase: VII — Abuse & Adversarial Resistance (DEFINITION ONLY)
- Phase intent: Define abuse visibility without prevention or moralization.
- Phase exit gate: If abuse occurs, visibility limits are explicit and not denied.

Phase rule: Items in Current/Next/Active must be allowed work for the declared phase in `boot/PROJECT_PHASE_CONSTITUTION.md`. Out-of-phase work must be refused and removed from those lists, not deferred.

## Current
- Enumerate abuse and misuse scenarios.
- Enumerate incentive and economic attack patterns.
- Define surfaced vs not surfaced abuse visibility with explanations.

## Next
- Draft Residual Harm Disclosure.
- Define Phase VII adversarial audit record scope.

## Active Tasks
- (none)

## Recently Completed
