# Integrator Home

This is the single status surface.

## Phase
- Phase: III — Binding
- Phase intent: Bind reality as irreversible record without judgment.
- Phase exit gate: No silent overwrite, hidden reset, or erasure through convenience.

Phase rule: Items in Current/Next/Active must be allowed work for the declared phase in `boot/PROJECT_PHASE_CONSTITUTION.md`. Out-of-phase work must be refused and removed from those lists, not deferred.

## Active Tasks
- (none)
