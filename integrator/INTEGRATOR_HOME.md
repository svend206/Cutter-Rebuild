# Integrator Home

This is the single status surface.

## Phase
- Phase: VIII — Abuse & Adversarial Resistance (CLOSED)
- Phase intent: Define abuse visibility without prevention or moralization.
- Phase exit gate: If this system is abused, visibility limits are explicit and not denied.

Phase rule: Items in Current/Next/Active must be allowed work for the declared phase in `boot/PROJECT_PHASE_CONSTITUTION.md`. Out-of-phase work must be refused and removed from those lists, not deferred.

## Current

## Next

## Active Tasks
- (none)
