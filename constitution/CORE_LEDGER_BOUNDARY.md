# Cutter Ledger ↔ State Ledger — Boundary & Symmetry

## Purpose
This document defines the constitutional boundary between the
**Cutter Ledger** (demonstrated operational reality)
and the **State Ledger** (explicit human recognition).

Its purpose is to ensure that:
- truth is not mistaken for recognition
- recognition is never inferred

---

## Distinct Roles
**Cutter Ledger**
- Records what operations demonstrated
- Preserves persistence and time-in-condition
- Refuses judgment and meaning

**State Ledger**
- Records what authority explicitly declares
- Binds recognition to time and authorship
- Refuses inference and automation

These systems are adjacent but independent.

---

## Allowed Interactions
- State Ledger entries may reference Cutter Ledger records
- Cutter Ledger records may be viewed during recognition

No automatic propagation is permitted.
Demonstrated reality does not become recognized state
without explicit human declaration.

---

## Prohibited Interactions
**Cutter Ledger must not:**
- infer recognition
- suggest state transitions
- auto-populate State Ledger entries
- escalate facts into declarations

**State Ledger must not:**
- infer reality from trends or persistence
- auto-update based on Cutter Ledger changes
- summarize or explain Cutter Ledger data

---

## Recognition Boundary
Recognition requires:
- an explicit act
- a named authority
- a timestamp
- a declared scope

Persistence alone is not recognition.  
Severity alone is not recognition.  
Time alone is not recognition.

---

## Symmetry Statement
The Cutter Ledger answers:
> “What has been true, and for how long?”

The State Ledger answers:
> “What has been acknowledged as true?”

These are not interchangeable questions.

---

## Failure Conditions
This boundary is violated if:
- recognition occurs without declaration
- declaration occurs without awareness
- either system substitutes for the other

When recognition becomes implicit, accountability disappears.

---

## Closing Statement
Reality does not demand recognition.
Recognition must be chosen.

The Cutter Ledger preserves reality
so recognition cannot claim ignorance.
