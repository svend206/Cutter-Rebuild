# State Ledger — Exclusions

## Purpose
This document defines what State Ledger explicitly excludes.
These exclusions are not limitations.
They are safeguards.

State Ledger’s value depends on refusing capabilities that would introduce interpretation, prescription, or reassurance.
Any implementation that violates these exclusions is not State Ledger.

---

## Exclusion Principle
State Ledger excludes anything that:
- substitutes judgment for recognition
- embeds interpretation into structure
- reduces discomfort by offering reassurance
- converts declaration into debate
- delays acknowledgment through explanation

The system must remain austere to remain trustworthy.

---

## Excluded Functions
State Ledger does not include:
- alerts or notifications
- thresholds or limits
- escalation rules

These functions necessarily encode judgment.

Category boundaries (reporting, decision, analytics, predictive)
are defined in `constitution/state_ledger/STATE_NEVER_BECOME.md`.

---

## Excluded Data Types
State Ledger does not ingest or calculate:
- performance metrics
- KPIs
- benchmarks
- financial ratios
- variance targets
- market comparisons
- sentiment measures

Such data invites interpretation and debate.
State Ledger is not an analytics platform (see `constitution/state_ledger/STATE_NEVER_BECOME.md`).

---

## Excluded Language
State Ledger does not use language that implies:
- improvement or decline
- success or failure
- urgency or safety
- blame or fault
- confidence or concern

All language must remain descriptive and time-bound.

---

## Excluded Behaviors
State Ledger does not allow:
- implicit reaffirmation
- default carry-forward
- bulk acknowledgment
- proxy recognition
- retrospective edits
- silent ownership transfer

Each recognition must be explicit and attributable.

---

## Excluded Use Cases
State Ledger is not to be used for:
- performance management
- employee evaluation
- compliance reporting
- audit substitution
- strategy formulation
- decision justification

Using State Ledger for these purposes corrupts its epistemic role.

---

## Relationship to Operational Systems
Operational and analytical systems may coexist alongside State Ledger.
They may provide inputs.

They must not:
- drive recognition
- override declarations
- reinterpret recorded state

State Ledger remains independent of operational truth claims.

---

## Why Exclusion Is Essential
Every excluded capability makes the system more comfortable.
Comfort delays recognition.

State Ledger exists to preserve epistemic friction.

---

## Closing Statement
State Ledger protects value not by adding intelligence,
but by refusing to dilute recognition.

What it excludes is as important as what it records.
