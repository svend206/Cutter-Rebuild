# What State Ledger Will Never Become

## Purpose
This document defines the permanent boundaries of State Ledger.
These are not roadmap constraints.
They are identity constraints.

State Ledger is only useful if it remains narrow, austere, and resistant to expansion.
Anything that violates these boundaries destroys its epistemic value.

---

## State Ledger Will Never Become an ERP
State Ledger does not manage operations.

It does not:
- schedule work
- allocate resources
- track inventory
- manage finances
- model processes

Operational systems explain *how* work is done.
State Ledger records *what reality has been acknowledged*.

These roles must remain separate.

---

## State Ledger Will Never Become a Reporting Tool
State Ledger is not designed to summarize, visualize, or communicate performance.

It does not:
- generate reports
- create dashboards
- highlight trends
- surface insights

Reporting systems optimize understanding.
State Ledger preserves acknowledgment.

---

## State Ledger Will Never Become a Decision System
State Ledger does not:
- recommend actions
- rank options
- evaluate tradeoffs
- justify outcomes

Decisions remain human responsibilities.
State Ledger exists only to ensure that decisions are not deferred accidentally.

---

## State Ledger Will Never Become an Analytics Platform
State Ledger does not compute:
- metrics
- scores
- benchmarks
- forecasts
- probabilities

Analytics introduce interpretation.
Interpretation delays recognition.

---

## State Ledger Will Never Become a Governance Framework
State Ledger does not define:
- policies
- controls
- approval chains
- compliance structures

It records reality as declared by authority.
Governance may act on that reality.
State Ledger does not participate in that action.

---

## State Ledger Will Never Become a Cultural Tool
State Ledger is not designed to:
- motivate
- align
- inspire
- build trust
- reduce conflict

Any cultural effect is incidental.
The system does not optimize for comfort.

---

## State Ledger Will Never Become a Substitute for Leadership
State Ledger does not:
- enforce accountability
- compel action
- prevent failure

Leaders may still choose poorly.
State Ledger ensures they do so knowingly.

---

## State Ledger Will Never Become Predictive
State Ledger does not attempt to foresee the future.

Prediction invites debate.
Debate delays recognition.

---

## State Ledger Will Never Become Gentle
State Ledger will not be:
- friendly
- reassuring
- adaptive to avoidance

Discomfort is a necessary property.

---

## Relationship to Other Products
State Ledger is a standalone product.
It may coexist with:
- operational systems
- financial systems
- planning tools

It does not integrate in ways that compromise its constraints.
Adjacency is permitted.
Dependency is not.

---

## Final Boundary
If a proposed feature makes State Ledger:
- more helpful
- more insightful
- more actionable
- more pleasant

It is likely wrong.

State Ledger exists to make delayed recognition harder than early discomfort.

---

## Closing Statement
State Ledger preserves value by remaining narrow.

The moment it tries to do more,
it will do less of what matters.
