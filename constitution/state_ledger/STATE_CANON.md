# State Ledger — Canon

## Scope
This document defines the non-negotiable constraints that govern State Ledger.

These constraints exist to prevent epistemic failure under authority.
They are not guidelines, preferences, or best practices.

Any implementation that violates these constraints is not State Ledger.

- `constitution/CORE_LEDGER_BOUNDARY.md`

## Definitions
**Entity**  
A bounded organizational unit whose state can be declared. Examples include the company as a whole or a functional department.

**State**  
A one-sentence, present-tense declaration describing current reality. States are descriptive, not explanatory.

**Classification**  
A constrained label applied to a state to indicate directional condition without interpretation.

**Recognition Owner**  
The individual with authority to affirm or reclassify an entity’s state.

**Reaffirmation**  
An explicit declaration that a previously stated state remains accurate.

**Reclassification**  
An explicit declaration that a previously stated state is no longer accurate.

**Continuity**  
The persistence of a state across time through reaffirmation.

**Irreversibility**  
The condition in which delay has materially reduced or eliminated available options.

---

## Core Axiom
**Waiting is not neutral.**

When an entity continues operating without reclassification, it is choosing continuity.
State Ledger exists to ensure this choice is explicit.

---

## Canonical Constraints

### C1. Explicit Recognition
Every entity must have exactly one recognition owner at all times.

Recognition may not be implicit, collective, or assumed.
If recognition ownership is unclear, epistemic failure is already present.

---

### C2. No Silent Continuity
A state may persist only through explicit reaffirmation.

Silence, omission, or failure to update does not constitute reaffirmation.
Continuity must be declared, not inferred.

---

### C3. Time Is First-Class
Time in state is a primary datum.

Unchanged states accumulate time.
Time does not reset unless a state is reclassified.

---

### C4. Irreversible Memory
Past declarations may not be edited, deleted, or rewritten.

New declarations supersede prior ones but do not erase them.
State Ledger preserves what was acknowledged at the time it was acknowledged.

---

### C5. Separation of Recognition and Action
State Ledger records recognition only.

It does not record plans, actions, explanations, or outcomes.
Recognition precedes action but does not prescribe it.

---

### C6. No Prediction
State Ledger does not forecast outcomes or estimate futures.

Prediction invites negotiation with the future rather than recognition of the present.

---

### C7. No Optimization
State Ledger does not optimize for performance, efficiency, or alignment.

Optimization pressure distorts recognition.

---

### C8. Recognition Under Authority
Recognition must be made by individuals with authority to act or to reclaim authority.

Delegation of recognition without delegation of authority is invalid.

---

### C9. Recognition Survives Turnover
State Ledger is not reset by changes in leadership, ownership, or personnel.

Continuity of record is preserved across authority transitions.

---

## Failure Conditions
State Ledger is considered compromised if:
- recognition is delegated to individuals without authority
- states persist without explicit reaffirmation
- past declarations can be edited or erased
- interpretation is embedded in classification
- reassurance replaces declaration

Any of these conditions invalidate the ledger.

---

## Canonical Guarantee
If implemented according to this canon:
- Non-change will be visible
- Time will be undeniable
- Recognition will be explicit
- Irreversibility will not be crossed silently

State Ledger does not prevent failure.
It prevents failure from being unrecognized.

---

## Canonical Boundary
State Ledger makes no claim about:
- what decisions should be made
- when action should be taken
- whether a state is acceptable

Those judgments remain human responsibilities.
State Ledger exists to ensure they are made consciously.

---

## Closing Statement
Epistemic failure is not a lack of information.
It is the allowance of continued operation without explicit recognition.

This canon exists to remove that allowance.
