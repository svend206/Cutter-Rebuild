# Cutter — Guild Boundary (Authoritative)

## Purpose
Define the Cutter ↔ Guild firewall and the required language rules inside Cutter.

The Guild product definition lives in:
`constitution/guild/GUILD_CONSTITUTION.md`.

---

## Relationship to Cutter (Hard Firewall)
Cutter and the Guild are **separate products with separate constitutions**.

Therefore:
- Guild intelligence must never appear in Ops
- must never appear in Cutter Ledger UX
- must never influence State Ledger recognition

---

## Language Normalization (Repo-Wide)
Forbidden language anywhere in the repo:
- “neutral”
- “non-influential”
- “decision support”
- “fairness”
- “leveling the playing field”

Required language:
- “market intelligence”
- “shop-only”
- “information parity with customers”

---

## Drift Test
If it is unclear whether the Guild is allowed to influence shop behavior, the documentation has failed.
