# Ledger UX Constitution (Non-Negotiable)

## State Ledger UX
Purpose:
To record explicit human recognition of what is true.

Must show:
- entity name
- recognition owner
- cadence
- last declared statement (verbatim)
- time since last declaration

Must not show:
- Ops signals
- Cutter event lists
- counts, trends, thresholds
- prioritization or selection
- dashboards or health indicators

Recognition must be ceremonial.  
Checkboxes are forbidden.

---

## Cutter Ledger UX
Purpose:
To make demonstrated operational reality undeniable over time.

Must show:
- raw events
- timestamps
- repetition
- absence
- provenance

Must not:
- highlight importance
- suggest action
- surface topics
- rank, score, or color
- imply obligation

Cutter Ledger UX increases discomfort without increasing guidance.

## Canonical Test
If a user can say:  
“The system showed us this, so…”

The UX has violated the constitution.

Boundary directionality is defined in `constitution/CORE_LEDGER_BOUNDARY.md`.
