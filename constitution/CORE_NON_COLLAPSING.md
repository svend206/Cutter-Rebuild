# Non-Collapsing Principle

## Non-Collapsing Principle (authoritative)
Problem: collapsed or sanitized information destroys decision quality at the highest consequence.

Rules:
- Signals must remain intact to the person who carries consequences.

Interpretation boundaries are defined in `constitution/CORE_INTERPRETATION_BOUNDARY.md`.

## Ops Separation Supports Flow (design intent; non-normative)
Design intent only:
- Execution and planning separation supports flow state by preserving clear goals, immediate feedback, and distraction elimination.
