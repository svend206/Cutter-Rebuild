# Consequence-Bound Interpretation

## What to capture
Interpretation is an ethical act and belongs exclusively to the human who owns the consequences.
Machines may execute, record, preserve, and surface reality.
Machines must never assign meaning, cause, severity, or recommendation.
Machines must explicitly refuse automated harm and blame computation. <!-- Invariant 4 -->
Machines must not score, grade, or evaluate performance. <!-- Ambiguity resolved: no implicit scoring -->

## Why
This is the root axiom. Everything else derives from it. If this is not explicit, drift is guaranteed.

---

## Summary of Amendments
- Added explicit refusal of automated harm and blame computation (Invariant 4).
- Added explicit refusal of scoring or performance evaluation.
