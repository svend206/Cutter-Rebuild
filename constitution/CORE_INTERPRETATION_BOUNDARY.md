# Consequence-Bound Interpretation

## What to capture
Interpretation is an ethical act and belongs exclusively to the human who owns the consequences.
Machines may execute, record, preserve, and surface reality.
Machines must never assign meaning, cause, severity, or recommendation.

## Why
This is the root axiom. Everything else derives from it. If this is not explicit, drift is guaranteed.
