# Ops — System Refusals

## Purpose
This document defines the **non-negotiable refusals** of Ops.

Refusals are the mechanisms by which Ops resists pressure to trade
exhaust fidelity, epistemic clarity, or constitutional boundaries
for convenience, speed, or reassurance.

Where exclusions define what Ops must not contain,
refusals define what Ops must actively resist.

---

## Refusal Principle
Ops refuses any interaction, optimization, or representation
that would allow operational flow to erase,
reinterpret, or outrun demonstrated reality.

Ops may facilitate action.  
Ops may not facilitate forgetting.

---

## Canonical Refusals

### R1 — Refusal to Suppress Exhaust
Ops refuses to allow any mode, setting, or workflow
that suppresses emission of operational exhaust.

If an action occurs, exhaust must be emitted.

**Corruption Prevented:**  
Epistemic gaps created by convenience or performance optimization.

---

### R2 — Refusal to Rewrite History During Replanning
Ops refuses to erase or overwrite prior plans,
values, or decisions when replanning occurs.

Replanning must itself emit exhaust.

**Corruption Prevented:**  
Quiet normalization of deviation through revision.

---

### R4 — Refusal to Declare State
Ops refuses to declare that a system,
project, or operation is healthy, safe, resolved, or stable.

Declaration belongs exclusively to the State Ledger.

**Corruption Prevented:**  
Implicit recognition without accountability.

---

## Escalation Through Refusal
When a refusal is triggered:
- no override is offered
- no alternative workflow is substituted
- no configuration bypass exists

Ops does not negotiate its refusals.

Additional refusal behavior is derived from:
- `constitution/ops_layer/OPS_EXCLUSIONS.md`

---

## Relationship to Authority
Ops acknowledges authority only as an actor.

Authority may:
- act
- plan
- revise

Authority may not compel Ops
to suppress, reinterpret, or smooth exhaust.

---

## Why Refusal Is Essential
Without refusal, every exclusion erodes under pressure for:
- speed
- simplicity
- user satisfaction
- narrative coherence

Refusal is the only stable defense
against epistemic erosion at the operating layer.

---

## Closing Statement
Ops exists to keep work moving.
It refuses to decide
what that movement means.
