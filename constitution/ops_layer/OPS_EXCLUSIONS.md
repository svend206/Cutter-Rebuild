# Ops — Exclusions

## Purpose
This document defines what **Ops explicitly excludes** in order to preserve
clear separation between **action**, **truth**, and **recognition**.

These exclusions prevent Ops from quietly acquiring epistemic authority
under the guise of convenience, intelligence, or helpfulness.

---

## Exclusion Principle
Ops excludes any function, behavior, or representation that would allow
operational activity to substitute for truth,
or action to substitute for recognition.

Exclusion is how Ops remains an operating system
rather than a narrative system.

---

## Excluded Functions
Ops must not perform or host:
- Binding of historical truth
- Aggregation of long-term variance
- Interpretation of persistence or drift
- Risk scoring or health scoring
- Automatic escalation based on history
- Epistemic summaries of “how things are going”

**Corruption Prevented:**  
Conversion of accumulated reality into operational narrative.

---

## Excluded System Roles
Ops must not act as:
- A source of organizational truth
- A judge of performance or correctness
- A substitute for recognition
- A compliance authority
- A historical memory system

**Corruption Prevented:**  
Role confusion that allows action to overwrite evidence.

---

## Excluded Language
Ops must not use language that implies:
- Finality (“resolved”, “closed”)
- Historical correctness (“back on track”)
- Epistemic confidence (“under control”, “stable”)
- Moral judgment (“good”, “bad”, “acceptable”)

**Corruption Prevented:**  
Narrative closure that replaces explicit recognition.

---

## Excluded Data Transformations
Ops must not:
- Rewrite history during replanning
- Collapse sequences into current state
- Discard earlier revisions
- Hide the number or frequency of changes
- Replace prior values with “latest value only”

**Corruption Prevented:**  
Erasure of demonstrated reality through operational revision.

---

## Excluded Emotional Functions
Ops must not be designed to:
- Reduce discomfort caused by accumulated facts
- Provide reassurance about trends
- Preserve optimism through abstraction
- Shield users from confronting history

**Corruption Prevented:**  
Emotional insulation from epistemic pressure.

---

## Excluded Usage Patterns
Ops must not support:
- “Clean slate” replanning
- Silent resets
- Bulk normalization of deviations
- One-click dismissal of accumulated change
- Workflows that bypass acknowledgment entirely

**Corruption Prevented:**  
Avoidance disguised as efficiency.

---

## Excluded Visual Patterns
Ops must not employ:
- Visual metaphors implying resolution
- Progress indicators that imply epistemic completion
- Status badges that collapse time
- Visual hierarchy that implies importance of history

**Corruption Prevented:**  
Visual judgment that bypasses explicit declaration.

---

## Relationship to Adjacent Systems
**Cutter Ledger**
- Holds demonstrated reality
- Is not summarized or collapsed by Ops

**State Ledger**
- Holds explicit recognition
- Is not inferred or auto-populated by Ops

Ops must remain visually and functionally distinct
from both ledgers.

---

## Why Exclusion Is Essential
Without these exclusions, Ops would gradually become:
- a comforting narrator
- a soft judge
- a silent normalizer of drift

These outcomes destroy the separation that prevents late, unknowable failure.

---

## Closing Statement
Ops excludes epistemic authority
so action cannot overwrite reality.

Work may continue.
Meaning must wait.
