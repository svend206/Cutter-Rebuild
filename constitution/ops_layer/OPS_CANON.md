# Ops — Canon

## Purpose
Ops exists to **perform work**.

It is the operating surface where plans are formed, decisions are executed,
and actions occur. Ops exists to enable continuity of operation while producing
a complete, lossless record of what was done.

Ops does not exist to determine truth.  
Ops does not exist to determine state.  
Ops exists to act.

---

## Scope
Ops governs:
- Planning, execution, and replanning of work
- User interaction required to operate the system
- Workflow optimization for speed, clarity, and completion
- Domain-specific concepts, language, and semantics
- Emission of operational exhaust

Ops does not govern:
- Historical truth
- Persistence or time-in-condition
- Recognition or declaration of state
- Interpretation of accumulated reality

Ops is an operating system, not a ledger.

---

## Definitions
**Operation**  
A discrete act, decision, or execution performed by a user or system actor.

**Plan**  
A provisional representation of intended future operations.

**Replanning**  
The act of modifying a plan in response to new information or constraints.

**Operational Exhaust**  
Immutable records emitted by Ops representing:
- actions taken
- values chosen or overridden
- timestamps
- role identity
- non-occurrence where applicable

**Domain Meaning**  
Industry- or context-specific semantics required to perform work.

---

## Core Axiom
**Ops may optimize action.  
Ops may not optimize truth.**

---

## Prime Directive
Ops must ensure that every operationally relevant action,
decision, revision, and omission produces exhaust
sufficient for downstream ledgers to preserve reality.

Ops must never trade exhaust fidelity for convenience.

---

## Canonical Constraints
### O1 — Exhaust Is Mandatory
Every operationally relevant interaction must emit exhaust.

No mode, setting, or optimization may suppress emission.

---

### O2 — Exhaust Is Irreversible
Once emitted, exhaust may not be altered, reinterpreted, or erased by Ops.

Correction may occur only through subsequent actions that emit new exhaust.

---

### O3 — Domain Meaning Resides Here
All industry- and context-specific meaning lives in Ops.

Ops must translate domain events into epistemic primitives
without exporting meaning to the ledgers.

---

### O4 — Plans Are Provisional
Plans have no epistemic authority.

Replanning does not erase what has already been demonstrated.

---

### O5 — Optimization Is Local
Ops may optimize for the current task context only.

Ops must not optimize for historical appearance, narrative coherence,
or avoidance of accumulated discomfort.

---

## Failure Conditions
Ops is constitutionally failed if it:
- Allows action without emitting exhaust
- Collapses history into the current plan
- Treats repeated deviation as resolved by familiarity
- Suppresses inconvenient records to preserve flow
- Enables authority to unknowingly outrun evidence

Failure is defined by loss of exhaust fidelity, not usability issues.

---

## Canonical Boundary
Ops binds **action only**.

It does not bind:
- truth (Cutter Ledger)
- recognition (State Ledger)

Any attempt by Ops to assume those roles
constitutes a category error.

---

## Relationship to Other Systems
**Cutter Ledger**
- Receives exhaust from Ops
- Preserves demonstrated reality
- Does not advise Ops

**State Ledger**
- Receives explicit declarations from authority
- Does not infer from Ops behavior

Export to Guild requires an explicit human action in Ops.

Ops may reference both ledgers,
but may not collapse their functions into itself.

---

## Canonical Guarantee
If an action occurred,
and if Ops permitted it,
that action will be recorded.

Ops guarantees continuity of operation
without continuity of narrative.

---

## Closing Statement
Ops exists to keep work moving.
It is constitutionally forbidden
from deciding what that movement means.
