# UX Language Boundary

## What to capture
Users may speak in their language.  
The system must never think in that language.

Concrete UX rules to capture:
- User terms allowed only as labels or predicates
- Refusals appear only at boundary crossings

Predicate transparency and instance-first constraints are defined in
`constitution/CORE_QUERY_LAYER_RULES.md`.

## Why
Without this, you’ll either alienate users or violate constitution. This is the needle.
