# Cutter Ledger — Canon

## Purpose
The Cutter Ledger exists to bind **demonstrated operational reality** over time.

It preserves what operations *showed*, not what was planned, hoped, or explained.
Its function is to ensure that variance, drift, persistence, and time-in-condition
cannot be forgotten, normalized, or rewritten.

The Cutter Ledger exists to prevent epistemic failure by making reality durable.

## Inherits
- `constitution/CORE_INTERPRETATION_BOUNDARY.md`
- `constitution/CORE_NON_COLLAPSING.md`
- `constitution/CORE_LEDGER_BOUNDARY.md`

---

## Scope
The Cutter Ledger governs:
- Append-only recording of operational exhaust
- Temporal binding of values, deltas, and changes
- Preservation of frequency, magnitude, and duration
- Presentation of historical facts

The Cutter Ledger does **not** govern:
- Operations or workflow
- Planning or replanning
- Optimization or prioritization
- Recognition, declaration, or judgment

The Cutter Ledger is not an operating system.
The Cutter Ledger is not a decision system.
The Cutter Ledger is not an authority.

---

## Definitions
**Demonstrated Reality**  
What operations actually produced, including overrides, changes, delays, and absences.

**Exhaust**  
Immutable records emitted by an operating system (Ops or external equivalent)
representing actions taken, values chosen, timestamps, and non-occurrences.

**Persistence**  
The continued presence of a condition over time, regardless of familiarity.

**Time-in-Condition**  
The duration for which a particular variance or state has remained true.

**Ledger**  
An append-only system of record that refuses erasure, reinterpretation, and smoothing.

---

## Core Axiom
**Time does not resolve variance.  
Familiarity does not resolve variance.  
Only contrary evidence resolves variance.**

---

## Prime Directive
The Cutter Ledger must ensure that no sustained operational reality
can remain epistemically invisible through time.

If something has been true repeatedly, or for long enough,
the Cutter Ledger must preserve that fact intact.

---

## Canonical Constraints
### C1 — Append-Only Memory  
All records are immutable once written.  
Correction may occur only through additional records.

### C2 — Outcome Agnosticism  
The Cutter Ledger records outcomes only as factual categories.
It must not encode success, failure, health, or quality.

### C3 — Persistence Without Normalization  
Repeated variance must remain visible.
Repetition does not reduce salience.

### C4 — Time Is a First-Class Fact  
Duration and sequence are primary data, not metadata.

### C5 — Industry Agnosticism (Hard Invariant)  
The Cutter Ledger is intentionally industry-agnostic.

It must not:
- Encode domain-specific concepts
- Contain industry-named fields or metrics
- Embed assumptions about normal, acceptable, or severe variance
- Learn what “matters” in any operating context

The Cutter Ledger binds only epistemic primitives:
- Values
- Deltas
- Time
- Frequency
- Duration
- Role
- Scope

Any attempt to teach the Cutter Ledger domain meaning is a constitutional violation.

---

## Failure Conditions
The Cutter Ledger is constitutionally failed if it:
- Allows demonstrated reality to be overwritten
- Allows variance to disappear through aggregation or smoothing
- Allows time to be hidden or collapsed
- Cooperates in avoidance or reassurance
- Adapts its behavior to operational convenience

Failure is defined by epistemic corruption, not system downtime.

---

## Canonical Boundary
The Cutter Ledger binds **demonstrated reality only**.

It does not:
- Advise
- Optimize
- Warn
- Prioritize
- Declare state

Those functions, if they exist, belong elsewhere.

---

## Relationship to Other Systems
**Ops (Operating Layer)**
- Emits exhaust to the Cutter Ledger
- Holds domain meaning and workflow
- May not rewrite or summarize ledger history

**State Ledger**
- Records explicit human recognition
- May reference Cutter Ledger records
- Must not be auto-updated or inferred

Adjacency is permitted.  
Dependency is not.

---

## Canonical Guarantee
If a condition has persisted,
and if operations have demonstrated it,
the Cutter Ledger will preserve that fact
without explanation, mitigation, or comfort.

---

## Closing Statement
The Cutter Ledger does not prevent failure.

It prevents failure from remaining unknowable.

If the Cutter Ledger ever makes reality easier to ignore,
it has already failed.
