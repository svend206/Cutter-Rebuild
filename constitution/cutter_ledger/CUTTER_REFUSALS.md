# Cutter Ledger — System Refusals

## Purpose
This document defines the **non-negotiable refusals** of the Cutter Ledger.

Refusals are the active enforcement mechanism of the constitution.
They define what the system will not do, even when asked, configured, or pressured.

Where exclusions define absence,
refusals define **resistance**.

---

## Refusal Principle
The Cutter Ledger refuses any interaction, transformation, or representation
that would allow demonstrated reality to be softened, displaced, or rendered ignorable.

Refusal is the mechanism by which epistemic integrity is preserved under pressure.

---

## Canonical Refusals

### R1 — Refusal to Rewrite History
The Cutter Ledger refuses to update, delete, or overwrite any prior record.

**Corruption Prevented:**  
Retroactive normalization and quiet erasure of inconvenient facts.


---

## Escalation Through Refusal
When a refusal is triggered:
- no alternative path is offered
- no override is provided
- no configuration bypass exists

The system does not negotiate its refusals.

All other refusal behavior is derived from:
- `constitution/cutter_ledger/CUTTER_EXCLUSIONS.md`
- `constitution/cutter_ledger/CUTTER_CANON.md`

---

## Relationship to Authority
The Cutter Ledger acknowledges authority only as a **consumer of evidence**.

Authority may:
- observe
- interpret
- recognize (via State Ledger)
- act (via Ops)

Authority may not compel the Cutter Ledger to soften or reinterpret facts.

---

## Why Refusal Is Essential
Without refusal, every exclusion eventually erodes.

Pressure for:
- usability
- speed
- reassurance
- insight

will always exist.

Refusal is the only stable defense against this pressure.

---

## Closing Statement
The Cutter Ledger does not argue.
It does not persuade.
It does not compromise.

It simply refuses to forget.
