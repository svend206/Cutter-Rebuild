# Cutter Ledger — Exclusions

## Purpose
This document defines what the **Cutter Ledger explicitly excludes** in order to preserve its epistemic integrity.

These exclusions are not missing features.
They are defensive constraints that prevent the Cutter Ledger from collapsing into
an operating system, an advisory system, or a judgment engine.

---

## Exclusion Principle
The Cutter Ledger excludes any function, concept, or behavior that would allow
demonstrated reality to be softened, reinterpreted, prioritized, or made negotiable.

Exclusion is the mechanism by which the Cutter Ledger remains trustworthy.

---

## Excluded Functions
The Cutter Ledger must not perform or host:
- Planning or replanning
- Scheduling or rescheduling
- Optimization or prioritization
- Recommendation or guidance
- Alerting framed as urgency
- Risk scoring or health scoring
- Forecasting or prediction

**Corruption Prevented:**  
Conversion of evidence into advice, which delays recognition and enables avoidance.

---

## Excluded System Roles
The Cutter Ledger must not act as:
- An operating surface
- A decision support tool
- A management dashboard
- A coaching system
- A monitoring or alerting authority
- A substitute for human judgment

**Corruption Prevented:**  
Confusion of epistemic recordkeeping with authority or control.

Outcome-agnostic language constraints are defined in
`constitution/cutter_ledger/CUTTER_CANON.md`.

---

## Excluded Data Transformations
The Cutter Ledger must not:
- Smooth variance
- Collapse history into summaries
- Normalize repeated deviation
- Average away outliers
- Hide duration through aggregation
- Replace sequences with snapshots

**Corruption Prevented:**  
Loss of persistence and time-in-condition, which are primary epistemic signals.

---

## Excluded Emotional Functions
The Cutter Ledger must not be designed to:
- Reassure
- Calm
- Motivate
- Encourage
- Reduce discomfort
- Preserve optimism

**Corruption Prevented:**  
Suppression of epistemic discomfort, which is the signal the system exists to preserve.

---

## Excluded Usage Patterns
The Cutter Ledger must not support:
- “At-a-glance” health views
- Single-number summaries
- Status badges
- Gamified progress indicators
- Success/failure rollups

**Corruption Prevented:**  
Replacement of accumulated reality with symbolic reassurance.

---

## Excluded Visual Patterns
The Cutter Ledger must not employ:
- Traffic-light color schemes
- Warning icons implying urgency
- Celebratory or consoling visuals
- Progress bars implying resolution
- Visual hierarchies that imply importance

**Corruption Prevented:**  
Visual prioritization that encodes judgment without explicit declaration.

---

## Relationship to Adjacent Systems
**Ops (Operating Layer)**  
May optimize, guide, and assist workflow.  
Must not collapse or reinterpret Cutter Ledger records.

**State Ledger**  
May record explicit recognition.  
Must not infer recognition from Cutter Ledger data.

The Cutter Ledger must remain visually and functionally distinct from both.

---

## Why Exclusion Is Essential
Without these exclusions, the Cutter Ledger would gradually evolve into:
- a better dashboard
- a smarter advisor
- a more comforting interface

Each of those outcomes destroys its epistemic purpose.

The Cutter Ledger remains valuable only so long as it refuses to help.

---

## Closing Statement
The Cutter Ledger excludes convenience in service of truth.

Anything that makes reality easier to bear
also makes it easier to ignore.

That trade is constitutionally forbidden.
