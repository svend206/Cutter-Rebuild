# Plan Inputs Gap Map (Reports + UI Reality)

| MVP Capability | Status (Implemented / Partial / Not Implemented / Unknown) | Evidence |
| --- | --- | --- |
| MVP-1 Ops emits exhaust | Implemented | `reports/REPORT_1_CURRENT_CAPABILITY_INVENTORY.md`, `reports/REPORT_3_DATA_AND_SCHEMA_FACTS.md`, `reports/REPORT_4_TEST_AND_RUNTIME_STATUS.md` |
| MVP-2 Cutter Ledger preserves reality | Implemented | `reports/REPORT_3_DATA_AND_SCHEMA_FACTS.md`, `reports/REPORT_4_TEST_AND_RUNTIME_STATUS.md` |
| MVP-3 Cutter Ledger meaning-free | Implemented | `reports/REPORT_1_CURRENT_CAPABILITY_INVENTORY.md`, `reports/REPORT_4_TEST_AND_RUNTIME_STATUS.md`, `context/UI_REALITY_REPORT.md` |
| MVP-4 Explicit state recognition | Implemented | `reports/REPORT_3_DATA_AND_SCHEMA_FACTS.md`, `reports/REPORT_4_TEST_AND_RUNTIME_STATUS.md` |
| MVP-5 Explicit reaffirmation required | Implemented | `reports/REPORT_1_CURRENT_CAPABILITY_INVENTORY.md`, `reports/REPORT_3_DATA_AND_SCHEMA_FACTS.md`, `reports/REPORT_4_TEST_AND_RUNTIME_STATUS.md` |
| MVP-6 Evidence references inert | Implemented | `reports/REPORT_1_CURRENT_CAPABILITY_INVENTORY.md`, `reports/REPORT_3_DATA_AND_SCHEMA_FACTS.md`, `reports/REPORT_4_TEST_AND_RUNTIME_STATUS.md` |
| MVP-7 Layer separation enforced | Implemented | `reports/REPORT_1_CURRENT_CAPABILITY_INVENTORY.md`, `reports/REPORT_5_GOVERNANCE_INTEGRITY_CHECK.md`, `context/UI_REALITY_REPORT.md` |
| MVP-8 Guild exhaust export | Implemented | `reports/REPORT_1_CURRENT_CAPABILITY_INVENTORY.md`, `reports/REPORT_2_SYSTEM_SURFACES_AND_ENTRYPOINTS.md`, `reports/REPORT_4_TEST_AND_RUNTIME_STATUS.md` |
| MVP-9 Document-governed authority | Implemented | `reports/REPORT_5_GOVERNANCE_INTEGRITY_CHECK.md` |
| MVP-10 Absence of action preserved | Implemented | `reports/REPORT_1_CURRENT_CAPABILITY_INVENTORY.md`, `reports/REPORT_3_DATA_AND_SCHEMA_FACTS.md`, `reports/REPORT_4_TEST_AND_RUNTIME_STATUS.md`, `context/UI_REALITY_REPORT.md` |
| MVP-11 Ops execution/planning separation | Implemented | `reports/REPORT_1_CURRENT_CAPABILITY_INVENTORY.md`, `reports/REPORT_4_TEST_AND_RUNTIME_STATUS.md`, `context/UI_REALITY_REPORT.md` |
| MVP-12 Reconciliation explicit, query-dependent, non-blocking | Unknown | `context/MVP_V2_COVERAGE_ASSERTION_TABLE.md` |
| MVP-13 Execution continuous and never gated | Unknown | `context/MVP_V2_COVERAGE_ASSERTION_TABLE.md` |
| MVP-14 Exhaust capture byproduct, not obligation | Unknown | `context/MVP_V2_COVERAGE_ASSERTION_TABLE.md` |
| MVP-15 Refusal of automated harm/blame computation | Unknown | `context/MVP_V2_COVERAGE_ASSERTION_TABLE.md` |

## Gap List

- MVP-12: No evidence identified for explicit, query-dependent, non-blocking reconciliation.
- MVP-13: No evidence identified for continuous execution without gating.
- MVP-14: No evidence identified for exhaust capture as byproduct without required explanations.
- MVP-15: No evidence identified for explicit refusal of automated harm or blame computation.
