# Cutter Layers — Think Different

Most business software is built to make things feel manageable.

It smooths.
It summarizes.
It reassures.
It helps you feel like problems are under control.

We think that’s dangerous.

---

We believe the most expensive failures in business don’t come from ignorance.
They come from knowing — but knowing too late.

From problems that were visible,
explainable,
reasonable,
and therefore ignored.

---

Most systems try to help you decide.

Cutter Layers does something different.

It helps you remember.

---

We believe:

That work should be easy to do,
but hard to forget.

That replanning should be allowed,
but never erase what the replanning revealed.

That explanations are human,
but memory should not depend on them.

That truth does not need interpretation —
only persistence.

---

Cutter Layers is not built to make you comfortable.

It is built to make it impossible
for reality to disappear quietly.

---

We don’t rank issues.
We don’t assign urgency.
We don’t declare healt
