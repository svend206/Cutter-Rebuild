I’m building a system that keeps signals intact all the way to the person who carries the consequences.
Interpretation is allowed — but only by the person who has to live with the decision.”

Collapsed information destroys decision quality at the point of highest consequence.

There’s a concept in organizational theory called the Thermocline of Truth. It describes a barrier where raw, uncomfortable reality from the front line stops rising and is replaced by sanitized, optimistic summaries. Below this line, people know a project is off track or a customer is unhappy. Above it, the dashboard still looks “green.” As an owner, you stop receiving raw signals and instead receive an accumulation of pre-interpreted data that obscures risk until it’s too late to act.

I’m building a system designed from the ground up to preserve signal clarity all the way to the person who bears the consequences. At its core is an ERP whose primary purpose is to emit clean, uncollapsed operational exhaust—and only secondarily to be a genuinely useful, even delightful, tool for running a business and meeting customer commitments.
