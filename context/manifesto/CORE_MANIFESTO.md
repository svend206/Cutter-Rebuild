# Core Manifesto

## Why This Exists
This manifesto records interpretive principles that explain why the system is shaped the way it is.  
It is descriptive and non-authoritative. It does not define behavior.

---

## Interpretive Principles
- Reports are repeatable questions, not conclusions.
- Gauges assert authority by existing.
- Defaults introduce normative gravity and relocate doubt.
- Blank slates preserve epistemic ownership.
- Second-guessing during execution degrades quality.
- Reconciliation is convergence, not completion.
- Execution produces facts; meaning is assigned later.
- Stability is preferred over twitching freshness for judgment.

---

## Failure Modes These Ideas Illuminate
- Dashboards that imply closure rather than inquiry.
- Metrics that become authority instead of evidence.
- Defaults that move uncertainty from humans to the system.
- Execution slowed by continual second-guessing.
- Reconciliation framed as a finish line rather than alignment.
- Judgment pulled toward novelty rather than stability.

## How to Read System Behavior
These principles frame how to interpret the system without turning interpretation into policy.  
They explain why some surfaces remain sparse, why questions recur, and why stability is emphasized when judgment is involved.
