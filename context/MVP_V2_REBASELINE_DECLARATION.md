# MVP v2.0 Re-Baseline Declaration

- MVP_CAPABILITIES_LOCKED v2.0 is now the sole authoritative MVP reference.
- All prior MVP evaluations, gap analyses, and verification artifacts created under v1.0 are non-authoritative.
- Existing artifacts may be used only as evidence candidates, not assumed-valid outputs.
- No artifact carries forward legitimacy by default.
