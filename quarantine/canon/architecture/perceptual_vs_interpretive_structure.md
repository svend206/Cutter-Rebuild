# A Perceptual vs Interpretive Structure Rule
## What to capture

This is new and important:

Perceptual structure (allowed):

time  
sequence  
duration  
frequency  
deltas  
provenance

Interpretive structure (forbidden):

scores  
health  
severity  
ranking  
“top issues”  
causal labels

Key line:

The system may structure perception but must never structure judgment.

## Why

This answers “If not dashboards, then what?” in a precise, defensible way.
