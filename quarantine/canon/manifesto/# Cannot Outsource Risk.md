# Cannot Outsource Risk

Cutter is for people who cannot outsource risk.
The people who sign things.
The people who make payroll.
The people where the buck stops.

This system exists for the moment you wake up at 2:00 a.m.
knowing something might be drifting
and knowing that if it is,
there is no one else to blame.

That feeling cannot be taught.
It only arrives after responsibility becomes real.

Cutter does not exist to reassure.
It exists so you cannot unknowingly outrun reality.
