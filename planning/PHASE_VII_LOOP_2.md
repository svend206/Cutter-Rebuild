### SECTION 1 — Decision Statement

The system makes no guarantees.

---

### SECTION 2 — Rationale

Conditional guarantees were considered, including refusal‑backed formulations; they were rejected because even refusal‑bound guarantees create a named claim surface that can be negotiated, expanded, or reinterpreted under pressure. Phase VI constraints are allowed to bind behavior without becoming claims; naming guarantees collapses constraints into promises and weakens the refusal posture by shifting emphasis from enforced behavior to asserted outcomes. “No guarantees are asserted” is a deliberate architectural posture that preserves uncertainty and refusal strength, not a temporary or conservative default.

### SECTION 3 — Final Guarantee Registry (If Applicable)

No guarantees are asserted.

---

### SECTION 4 — Final Non-Guarantee Affirmation

All Loop 1 denials remain in force. No denied or out-of-scope claim is elevated. Silence outside the Claim Consideration Log remains unauthorized and may not be implied.

---

### SECTION 5 — Phase VII Closure Statement

Phase VII is complete. The guarantee posture is final: no guarantees are asserted. Downstream phases (VIII and IX) are bound by this decision. No new guarantees may be introduced without reopening Phase VII.

STOP.
