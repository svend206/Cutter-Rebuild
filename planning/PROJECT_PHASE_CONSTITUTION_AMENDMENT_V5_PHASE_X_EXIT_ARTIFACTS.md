# CONSTITUTIONAL AMENDMENT v5
## Phase X Exit Artifacts Expansion

---

## Amendment Preconditions (Satisfied)

- **Proposed change is written in full** — see Full Replacement Text.
- **Reason for change is stated plainly** — see Reason for Change.
- **Impact on all phases is considered** — see Impact Analysis.
- **Compatibility with the Constitution is explicitly affirmed** — see Compatibility Statement.
- **Amendments by implication are forbidden** — all affected text is replaced in full.

---

## Sponsor and Authority

- **Named Human Sponsor:** Erik  
- **Named Human Approver:** Erik  

---

## Recorded Adversarial Review

- **Reviewer:** TBD (must not be the primary author)  
- **Review Record:** planning/PROJECT_PHASE_CONSTITUTION_AMENDMENT_V5_AUDIT.md  
- **Outcome Required:** PASS  

This amendment is not active until an adversarial review records **PASS**.

---

## Reason for Change (Plain Statement)

Phase X governs exit, shutdown, and irreversibility. The current definition lists only two artifacts, which does not provide enough explicit structure to prevent implied cleanup, hidden survivorship gaps, or exit-time reassurance. This amendment expands Phase X’s required artifacts to make shutdown semantics, survivorship boundaries, and irreversibility explicit and auditable, without granting new authority or reducing refusals.

---

## Compatibility Statement

This amendment:
- does **not** weaken any Global Invariant,
- does **not** reduce refusal requirements,
- does **not** automate judgment or authority,
- does **not** bypass phase discipline,
- does **not** resolve tension through vagueness.

If any conflict with the Constitution is discovered, **this amendment is void**.

## Full Prior Text (Replaced in Full)

#### Phase X — Exit, Shutdown, and Irreversibility (Definition Only)

##### Purpose

Phase X defines irreversible actions and exit conditions, including shutdown semantics.

---

##### Required Artifacts

- Irreversibility Register
- Shutdown Disclosure Statement

No exit behavior may imply guarantees not defined in Phase VII.

---

---

## Full Replacement Text

#### Phase X — Exit, Shutdown, and Irreversibility (Definition Only)

##### Purpose

Phase X defines exit, shutdown, and irreversibility boundaries without erasing, rewriting, or softening reality. Stopping the system must not create implied closure, safety, or correction.

---

##### Allowed Work

During Phase X, the project may **define and document**:
- shutdown semantics,
- irreversibility boundaries,
- exit disclosure constraints,
- survivorship scope for records defined as irreversible.

All outputs are declarative and refusal-compatible.

---

##### Forbidden Work

Phase X must not:
- implement tooling, automation, or operational execution,
- promise completeness, cleanup, or compliance sufficiency at exit,
- introduce guarantees not defined in Phase VII,
- soften historical records through exit framing.

---

##### Required Artifacts

- Shutdown Semantics Document
- Data Survivorship Map
- Irreversibility Register
- Exit Disclosure Statement
- Phase X Adversarial Audit Record

No exit behavior may imply guarantees not defined in Phase VII.

---

---

## Impact Analysis (All Phases)

- **Phases I–V:** Unchanged.  
- **Phase VI:** Unchanged; operability and refusal semantics preserved.  
- **Phase VII:** Unchanged; guarantees remain explicit and refusal-bound.  
- **Phase VIII:** Unchanged; abuse visibility remains non-competence.  
- **Phase IX:** Unchanged; commercialization boundaries remain intact.  
- **Phase X:** Expanded required artifacts for explicit exit, survivorship, and irreversibility boundaries.  
- **Phase XI:** Traceability remains required; additional Phase X artifacts become trace inputs.  

---

## Amendment Closure

This amendment becomes authoritative only after:
- adversarial review records PASS,
- amendment is committed and tagged.

Until then, the prior phase structure remains in force.
