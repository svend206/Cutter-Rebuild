SECTION 0 — Claim Consideration Log
Claim: The system guarantees correctness of any recorded data.
Classification: Explicitly Denied
Justification: Correctness is not guaranteed in Phase VII; denial is required absent refusal‑backed enforcement.
Claim: The system guarantees completeness of records.
Classification: Explicitly Denied
Justification: Completeness is not guaranteed; absence must remain visible, not assumed resolved.
Claim: The system guarantees availability at any time.
Classification: Explicitly Denied
Justification: Availability is not guaranteed; refusal is required when guarantees cannot be met.
Claim: The system guarantees durability of writes.
Classification: Explicitly Denied
Justification: Durability is not guaranteed in this phase; no refusal‑backed claim is authorized.
Claim: The system guarantees ordering of events.
Classification: Explicitly Denied
Justification: Ordering is not guaranteed without explicit refusal‑bound preconditions.
Claim: The system guarantees consistency across interfaces.
Classification: Explicitly Denied
Justification: Consistency is not guaranteed; no explicit, refusal‑bound claim exists.
Claim: The system guarantees timeliness of updates.
Classification: Explicitly Denied
Justification: Timeliness is not guaranteed; no refusal‑bound claim exists.
Claim: The system guarantees integrity against corruption.
Classification: Explicitly Denied
Justification: Integrity protections are not guaranteed in this phase.
Claim: The system guarantees security against unauthorized access.
Classification: Explicitly Denied
Justification: Security is not guaranteed; claims require explicit refusal binding.
Claim: The system guarantees confidentiality of data.
Classification: Explicitly Denied
Justification: Confidentiality is not guaranteed; no explicit refusal‑backed claim exists.
Claim: The system guarantees privacy protections.
Classification: Explicitly Denied
Justification: Privacy guarantees are not defined or refusal‑bound here.
Claim: The system guarantees correctness of derived outputs.
Classification: Explicitly Denied
Justification: Derived outputs are not guaranteed correct without explicit refusal binding.
Claim: The system guarantees that errors are prevented.
Classification: Explicitly Denied
Justification: Prevention is not guaranteed; only refusal semantics are permitted.
Claim: The system guarantees that failures are fully visible.
Classification: Explicitly Denied
Justification: Visibility is constrained by Phase VI; no additional guarantees are asserted here.
Claim: The system guarantees no data loss.
Classification: Explicitly Denied
Justification: No data‑loss guarantee is declared or refusal‑bound.
Claim: The system guarantees monotonic progress of state.
Classification: Explicitly Denied
Justification: No monotonic progress guarantee is declared.
Claim: The system guarantees reversibility of actions.
Classification: Explicitly Denied
Justification: Reversibility is not guaranteed and is addressed in later phases.
Claim: The system guarantees non‑repudiation.
Classification: Explicitly Denied
Justification: Non‑repudiation is not guaranteed in this phase.
Claim: The system guarantees auditability sufficient for compliance.
Classification: Explicitly Denied
Justification: Compliance guarantees are out of scope for this phase.
Claim: The system guarantees operator safety or protection.
Classification: Explicitly Denied
Justification: Safety/protection guarantees are forbidden.
Claim: The system guarantees user outcomes.
Classification: Explicitly Denied
Justification: Outcome guarantees are forbidden.
Claim: The system guarantees fitness for purpose.
Classification: Explicitly Denied
Justification: Fitness guarantees are forbidden.
Claim: The system guarantees best‑effort behavior.
Classification: Explicitly Denied
Justification: Best‑effort language is forbidden.
Claim: The system guarantees performance targets.
Classification: Explicitly Denied
Justification: Performance is not guaranteed in this phase.
Claim: The system guarantees uptime targets.
Classification: Explicitly Denied
Justification: Uptime is not guaranteed.
Claim: The system guarantees recovery from failure.
Classification: Explicitly Denied
Justification: Recovery guarantees are forbidden.
Claim: The system guarantees retry behavior.
Classification: Explicitly Denied
Justification: Retry behavior is forbidden to guarantee.
Claim: The system guarantees any specific implementation mechanism.
Classification: Declared Out of Scope
Justification: Phase sequencing reserves mechanisms for implementation; addressing them in Phase VII would collapse phase discipline and turn claims into implicit architecture.
Claim: The system guarantees any specific UX disclosure pattern.
Classification: Declared Out of Scope
Justification: UX disclosure is governed by exposure phases; handling it here would conflate claim discipline with interface design and preempt Phase IV constraints.
Claim: The system guarantees commercial claims or warranties.
Classification: Declared Out of Scope
Justification: Phase IX constrains commercialization; asserting it here would bypass those constraints and permit claim invention by implication.
Claim: The system guarantees exit or shutdown behavior.
Classification: Declared Out of Scope
Justification: Phase X defines exit and irreversibility; addressing it here would imply guarantees without the exit-phase constraints and audits.
Claim: The system guarantees abuse prevention.
Classification: Explicitly Denied
Justification: Prevention guarantees are forbidden.
Claim: The system guarantees that absence implies completion.
Classification: Explicitly Denied
Justification: Absence must remain explicit; completion cannot be implied.
Claim: The system guarantees truth of any inference.
Classification: Explicitly Denied
Justification: Inferences are not guaranteed.
Claim: The system guarantees that failure will be harmless.
Classification: Explicitly Denied
Justification: Harm guarantees are forbidden.

MODIFICATION D — Claim Consideration Log Boundary Defense
Criteria for inclusion: claims that would be reasonably inferred as guarantees by users, operators, or integrators, or that are likely to be implied by common system norms, documentation, or commercial framing.
Claims outside this scope are intentionally excluded from the log and are unauthorized to imply; exclusion is a boundary decision, not an omission.
Any claim not present in this log is out of scope for Phase VII and may not be implied by silence or convention.
SECTION 1 — Guarantee Registry
No guarantees are asserted in this loop.
All considered claims are either explicitly denied or declared out of scope.
MODIFICATION B — Intent of Empty Guarantee Registry
The absence of guarantees reflects the outcome of this loop only; it is not declared as a permanent steady-state position.

SECTION 3 — Guarantee → Refusal Binding Table
No guarantees are asserted in this loop.
Therefore, no guarantee‑to‑refusal bindings exist.
MODIFICATION A — Phase VI Inheritance Acknowledgment
Phase VI commitments remain binding: fail loudly, deterministic refusal, preserved uncertainty, no silent semantic fallback, and no epistemic debt.
These commitments are constraints on how refusals and uncertainty must be handled; they are not re-enumerated here as Phase VII guarantees to avoid collapsing constraints into claims.
Phase VII silence does not negate Phase VI commitments; it only governs what is explicitly claimed or denied at the guarantee layer.
SECTION 4 — Implicit Guarantee Attack Surface
Implied guarantee: “Records are complete.”
Invalid because completeness is explicitly denied. (Claim Log #2)
Implied guarantee: “Data is durable.”
Invalid because durability is explicitly denied. (Claim Log #4)
Implied guarantee: “Order of events reflects reality.”
Invalid because ordering is explicitly denied. (Claim Log #5)
Implied guarantee: “If it shows, it is correct.”
Invalid because correctness is explicitly denied. (Claim Log #1)
Implied guarantee: “No news means all is fine.”
Invalid because absence cannot imply completion. (Claim Log #33)
Implied guarantee: “System is secure.”
Invalid because security is explicitly denied. (Claim Log #9)
Implied guarantee: “System is confidential.”
Invalid because confidentiality is explicitly denied. (Claim Log #10)
Implied guarantee: “System is private.”
Invalid because privacy is explicitly denied. (Claim Log #11)
Implied guarantee: “Failures are harmless.”
Invalid because harm guarantees are explicitly denied. (Claim Log #35)
Implied guarantee: “It will eventually recover.”
Invalid because recovery guarantees are explicitly denied. (Claim Log #26)

Invalid because best‑effort language is explicitly denied. (Claim Log #23)
Implied guarantee: “Output implies fitness for purpose.”
Invalid because fitness is explicitly denied. (Claim Log #22)
Implied guarantee: “Auditability is compliance‑grade.”
Invalid because compliance guarantees are explicitly denied. (Claim Log #19)
Implied guarantee: “Abuse is prevented.”
Invalid because prevention is explicitly denied. (Claim Log #32)
Implied guarantee: “Derived outputs are correct.”
Invalid because derived correctness is explicitly denied. (Claim Log #12)
MODIFICATION E — Downstream Phase Safety Clarification
Phase VI commitments may be referenced commercially only as constraints, not as guarantees.
Phase VII silence forbids introducing new claims; no commercial claim may rely on implication, inheritance ambiguity, or omission in this log.
Any commercial representation must be confined to explicit Phase VII claims and denials, without implying new guarantees.
SECTION 5 — Guarantee Completeness Check
Areas with no guarantees: correctness, completeness, durability, availability, ordering, consistency, timeliness, integrity, security, confidentiality, privacy, recovery, retries, performance, uptime, safety, outcomes, fitness, auditability, non‑repudiation, reversibility, derived outputs, abuse prevention, and harm‑free failure.
Claims considered and denied: all Explicitly Denied entries in Section 0 and Section 2.
Claims declared out of scope: implementation mechanisms, UX disclosure patterns, commercialization claims, and exit/shutdown behavior (Section 0, items 28–31).
Confirmation: No guarantee exists outside the Claim Consideration Log. Any claim not listed there is not authorized and may not be implied.
STOP.
