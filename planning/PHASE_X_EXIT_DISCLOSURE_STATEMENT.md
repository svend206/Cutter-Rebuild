# Phase X — Exit Disclosure Statement

## 1. Purpose

This statement defines what is disclosed to users, customers, and operators at the moment of exit or shutdown.

It exists to prevent shutdown from being interpreted as:

* correction,
* completion,
* safety,
* or resolution.

This disclosure does not create guarantees.

## 2. What Exit Means

Exit means the system has ceased operation.

Specifically:

* the system no longer accepts new inputs,
* the system no longer executes operational workflows.

Exit does not revise, erase, validate, or reinterpret any prior record.

## 3. What Exit Does Not Do

Exit does not:

* correct prior records,
* resolve disputes, obligations, or errors,
* imply completeness of stored data,
* imply accuracy, safety, or compliance,
* imply reputational repair,
* imply that responsibilities have ended.

Stopping the system does not change what occurred while it was operating.

## 4. Records and Persistence

Some records may persist after exit.

Some records may not.

Persistence:

* refers only to record existence,
* does not imply usability, accessibility, or completeness,
* does not imply continued availability,
* does not imply successful export.

Absence of records after exit does not imply cleanup or deletion.
Presence of records after exit does not imply correctness or sufficiency.

## 5. Irreversibility

Certain actions and records are irreversible.

Exit does not reverse them.
Exit does not soften their meaning.
Exit does not restore lost options.

Irreversibility remains in effect regardless of:

* ownership,
* request,
* convenience,
* or timing of exit.

## 6. No Closure

Exit does not constitute closure.

Silence after exit is not evidence that:

* work was completed,
* issues were resolved,
* obligations were met,
* or harm was mitigated.

Any interpretation of closure is external to the system.

## 7. Responsibility

Exit does not transfer responsibility.

Human accountability for actions taken while the system was operating remains unchanged.

The system does not certify outcomes, intentions, or compliance at exit.

## 8. No Guarantees

This exit disclosure provides no guarantees.

In particular, it does not guarantee:

* data availability,
* data completeness,
* data usability,
* regulatory sufficiency,
* or future access.

If a guarantee is not explicitly defined in Phase VII, it does not exist here.

## 9. Interpretive Boundary

This statement describes limits only.

It does not advise, recommend, reassure, or judge.

Any meaning inferred beyond what is stated here is not supplied by the system.

END OF EXIT DISCLOSURE STATEMENT
