# Phase X — Exit, Shutdown, and Irreversibility

## Work Charter (Authoritative, Definition-Only)

---

## 1. Authority and Scope

This Work Charter governs **all work performed in Phase X**.

It derives authority from:

* the Constitution,
* the Project Phase Constitution,
* Phase VII (Guarantees & Claim Boundaries), and
* Phase IX (Commercialization Boundaries).

If any conflict exists, **this charter is void** and work must refuse.

Phase X is **definition-only**.
No implementation, tooling, automation, UI, migration scripts, or operational execution is authorized.

---

## 2. Purpose of Phase X

Phase X defines exit, shutdown, and irreversibility boundaries without erasing, rewriting, or softening reality. Stopping the system must not create implied closure, safety, or correction.

---

## 3. Binding Constraints (Inherited)

### 3.1 No New Guarantees (from Phase VII)

Exit behavior MUST NOT:

* imply correctness, completeness, durability, or safety,
* promise cleanup or compliance sufficiency at exit,
* introduce guarantees not defined in Phase VII.

---

## 4. Allowed Work

During Phase X, the project may **define and document** only the artifacts authorized by the Project Phase Constitution:

1. **Shutdown Semantics Document**
2. **Data Survivorship Map**
3. **Irreversibility Register**
4. **Exit Disclosure Statement**
5. **Phase X Adversarial Audit Record**

All outputs are declarative and refusal-compatible.

---

## 5. Forbidden Work

Phase X MUST NOT:

* implement tooling, automation, or operational execution,
* promise completeness, cleanup, or compliance sufficiency at exit,
* soften historical records through exit framing.

If a statement answers:

> "Does stopping create closure or correction?"

it is invalid.

---

## 6. Language Discipline

### 6.1 Required Properties

All Phase X language MUST:

* remain present-tense and declarative,
* describe loss, persistence, and limitation explicitly,
* avoid comfort framing.

### 6.2 Forbidden Framing (Non-Exhaustive)

Language MUST NOT include:

* "clean exit"
* "safe shutdown"
* "graceful shutdown"
* "compliance-ready"
* "risk-free"

No euphemisms.
No reassurance.

---

## 7. Required Artifacts

Phase X must produce **only** the artifacts explicitly authorized by the Project Phase Constitution:

1. **Shutdown Semantics Document**
2. **Data Survivorship Map**
3. **Irreversibility Register**
4. **Exit Disclosure Statement**
5. **Phase X Adversarial Audit Record**

No other standalone artifacts are authorized in this phase.

---

## 8. Exit Gate

Phase X may be exited only when a reviewer can truthfully say:

> "Stopping this system does not hide, revise, or soften reality."

---

## 9. Refusal Obligation

Any work that:

* exceeds this scope,
* introduces implication by analogy,
* or weakens the zero-guarantee posture

MUST be refused immediately.

Refusal is compliance.

---

## 10. Closure Rule

Phase X closes only through:

* completed artifacts,
* explicit pass/fail determination,
* commit, tag, and push.

No conditional passes.
No partial exits.

---

STOP.
