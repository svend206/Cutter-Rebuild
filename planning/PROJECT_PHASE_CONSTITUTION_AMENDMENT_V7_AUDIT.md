# Adversarial Review: Layer 2 Amendment (Revised)

---

### Overall Assessment

The revision directly addresses all observations from the prior review. The artifact discipline is tightened. The exploitable surfaces are closed. The amendment is now constitutionally sound with no remaining concerns.

---

### Prior Concern 1: RESOLVED — Artifact discipline tightened

**Previous concern:** Open artifact sets could allow gradual expansion that smuggles authority.

**Current text:**
> "Any artifact introduced in Layer 2 that is not listed as a recommended artifact MUST be subjected to adversarial review for implied authority, guarantees, or judgment before the phase may exit."
> "Each Layer 2 phase must produce at least one durable artifact sufficient for adversarial evaluation of its Exit Gate."

**Status:** Fixed. New artifacts require adversarial review. Every phase must produce auditable output. The flexibility remains but the guard rails are explicit.

---

### Prior Concern 2: RESOLVED — "Passed" language removed

**Previous concern:** "In a normative sense" qualifier was exploitable.

**Current text:**
> "label results as **'passed,' 'succeeded,' or 'verified.'**"

**Status:** Fixed. The terms are forbidden outright. No qualifier to exploit.

---

### Prior Concern 3: RESOLVED — Pilot conditions clarified

**Previous concern:** "Pilot conditions" could include success criteria, smuggling certification.

**Current text:**
> "Define pilot participation constraints"
> "Forbidden Work: define success criteria or readiness thresholds"

**Status:** Fixed. "Pilot conditions" is replaced with "pilot participation constraints." Success criteria are explicitly forbidden.

---

### Prior Concern 4: RESOLVED — Required artifact per phase

**Previous concern:** No Required Artifacts meant phases could exit with nothing to audit.

**Current text:**
> "Each Layer 2 phase must produce at least one durable artifact sufficient for adversarial evaluation of its Exit Gate."

**Status:** Fixed. Every phase must produce auditable output. Exit Gates have something concrete to evaluate.

### Verification of Structural Integrity

| Element | Status |
|---------|--------|
| Subordination explicit | ✓ "Layer 1 always wins" |
| Void clause present | ✓ "Layer 2 is void at that point" |
| Layer distinction clean | ✓ Layer 1 = what it can be; Layer 2 = how to ship |
| Layer 2 disclaims truth/correctness/safety | ✓ Explicit |
| Artifact discipline with adversarial review | ✓ Added |
| Minimum artifact requirement | ✓ Added |
| "Passed/succeeded/verified" forbidden | ✓ No qualifier |
| Success criteria forbidden in Phase XV | ✓ Explicit |
| Exit Gates maintain posture | ✓ All five correct |
| Final Closure Rule correct | ✓ Layer 1 continuously binding |
| Amendment void clause | ✓ Present |

### Attempted Attacks (Re-run)

**Attack 1:** Create "Customer Success Metrics" artifact in Phase XV

**Defense:** "Any artifact introduced... MUST be subjected to adversarial review for implied authority, guarantees, or judgment." Customer Success Metrics implies outcomes. Adversarial review would catch this.

**Verdict:** Attack blocked.

---

**Attack 2:** Define lifecycle state "Overdue" in Phase XII

**Defense:** Phase XII Forbidden Work: "imply 'healthy,' 'failing,' or 'acceptable'". "Overdue" is evaluative—it implies a deadline was missed and that matters.

**Verdict:** Attack blocked.

---

**Attack 3:** Label test results as "verified" in Phase XIV

**Defense:** Phase XIV Forbidden Work: "label results as 'passed,' 'succeeded,' or 'verified.'"

**Verdict:** Attack blocked.

---

**Attack 4:** Define pilot exit criteria in Phase XV

**Defense:** Phase XV Forbidden Work: "define success criteria or readiness thresholds."

**Verdict:** Attack blocked.

---

**Attack 5:** Exit Phase XII with no artifact

**Defense:** "Each Layer 2 phase must produce at least one durable artifact sufficient for adversarial evaluation of its Exit Gate."

**Verdict:** Attack blocked.

---

## Verdict

**PASS**

The amendment is constitutionally sound. All prior concerns have been addressed:

1. ✓ Artifact discipline includes adversarial review requirement
2. ✓ Minimum artifact per phase required
3. ✓ "Passed/succeeded/verified" forbidden without qualifier
4. ✓ Success criteria explicitly forbidden in Phase XV
5. ✓ Subordination, void clauses, and Final Closure Rule intact

The amendment correctly separates product realization from epistemic authority while maintaining Layer 1 supremacy. Layer 2 cannot override Layer 1. Shipping does not confer truth, safety, or authority.

The amendment may proceed to commitment.
