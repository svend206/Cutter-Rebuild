# CONSTITUTIONAL AMENDMENT v6
## Phase XI Implementation Artifacts Expansion

---

## Amendment Preconditions (Satisfied)

- **Proposed change is written in full** — see Full Replacement Text.
- **Reason for change is stated plainly** — see Reason for Change.
- **Impact on all phases is considered** — see Impact Analysis.
- **Compatibility with the Constitution is explicitly affirmed** — see Compatibility Statement.
- **Amendments by implication are forbidden** — all affected text is replaced in full.

---

## Sponsor and Authority

- **Named Human Sponsor:** Erik  
- **Named Human Approver:** Erik  

---

## Recorded Adversarial Review

- **Reviewer:** TBD (must not be the primary author)  
- **Review Record:** planning/PROJECT_PHASE_CONSTITUTION_AMENDMENT_V6_AUDIT.md  
- **Outcome Required:** PASS  

This amendment is not active until an adversarial review records **PASS**.

---

## Reason for Change (Plain Statement)

Phase XI authorizes implementation but currently requires only a coverage matrix. This leaves gaps in how implementation traceability, refusal placement, and omission visibility are audited. This amendment expands Phase XI’s required artifacts to make implementation accountability explicit and adversarially testable without introducing new authority or relaxing refusals.

---

## Compatibility Statement

This amendment:
- does **not** weaken any Global Invariant,
- does **not** reduce refusal requirements,
- does **not** automate judgment or authority,
- does **not** bypass phase discipline,
- does **not** resolve tension through vagueness.

If any conflict with the Constitution is discovered, **this amendment is void**.

---

## Full Prior Text (Replaced in Full)

#### Phase XI — Implementation (Execution)

##### Purpose

Phase XI authorizes implementation **only** as a realization of constraints defined in Phases VI–X.

---

##### Required Artifacts

- **Constraint Coverage Matrix**
  - Demonstrating that all constraints from Phases VI–X are:
    - realized, or
    - explicitly deferred with adversarial review

Selective implementation is forbidden.

## Full Replacement Text

#### Phase XI — Implementation (Execution)

##### Purpose

Phase XI authorizes implementation **only** as a realization of constraints defined in Phases VI–X.

---

##### Required Artifacts

1. **Constraint Coverage Matrix (Authoritative)**
   - Mapping every constraint from Phases VI–X to one of:
     - Implemented → component(s) named
     - Explicitly Unimplemented → reason + adversarial acknowledgment

2. **Implementation Trace Map**
   - For each implemented constraint:
     - which components realize it
     - where refusal occurs
     - where absence is surfaced

3. **Phase XI Adversarial Implementation Audit Record**
   - Adversarial review attempting to show:
     - meaning smuggled in through behavior
     - guarantees implied by UX
     - refusals inconsistent
     - omissions hidden

Selective implementation is forbidden.

---

---

## Impact Analysis (All Phases)

- **Phases I–V:** Unchanged.  
- **Phase VI:** Unchanged; operability and refusal semantics preserved.  
- **Phase VII:** Unchanged; guarantees remain explicit and refusal-bound.  
- **Phase VIII:** Unchanged; abuse visibility remains non-competence.  
- **Phase IX:** Unchanged; commercialization boundaries remain intact.  
- **Phase X:** Unchanged; exit artifacts and constraints preserved.  
- **Phase XI:** Expanded required artifacts for traceability and adversarial accountability.  

---

## Amendment Closure

This amendment becomes authoritative only after:
- adversarial review records PASS,
- amendment is committed and tagged.

Until then, the prior phase structure remains in force.
