# Phase II — Work Charter (Representation)

Phase: II — Representation

Status: Active

---

## Intent

Phase II exists to allow the system to **represent reality without interpreting it**.

The goal is to:
- give durable form to what may be observed or declared,
- make time, absence, and persistence representable,
- do so without deciding what any of it means.

This phase creates containers, not conclusions.

---

## Allowed Work (This Phase Only)

During Phase II, work may include:

- Defining **types of records** the system may hold
  (without defining behavior, evaluation, or response)

- Defining **distinctions between record types**, such as:
  - action vs declaration
  - observation vs recognition
  - present statements vs historical records

- Defining how **time is represented as part of each record**
- Defining how **absence and non-occurrence** are represented
- Defining how **reference relationships between records** are representable without collapsing roles
- Defining invariants about **immutability, ordering, and visibility**

All definitions must remain descriptive, not evaluative.

---

## Forbidden Work

During Phase II, the project must not:

- Assign meaning such as “good,” “bad,” “healthy,” or “concerning”
- Trigger or imply actions based on recorded information
- Recommend responses, priorities, or urgency
- Define thresholds, limits, or tolerances
- Rank, score, or classify records by value
- Introduce automation that affects behavior elsewhere
- Design workflows, interfaces, or user experiences

If a definition suggests “what should happen next,” it is out of scope.

---

## Required Outputs (to Exit Phase II)

Before Phase II can end, the following must exist:

- A clear description of **each record type** the system can hold
- A clear statement of **what each record explicitly does not mean**
- A description of how **time, duration, and sequence** are represented
- A description of how **absence and silence** are represented
- A description of how records remain **inspectable without collapse**

All outputs must avoid examples that imply action or judgment.

---

## Known Unknowns (Intentionally Preserved)

The following are explicitly not to be resolved in Phase II:

- What actions humans should take in response to records
- What states are acceptable or unacceptable
- How records are surfaced in any interface
- How humans are notified or alerted
- How records influence planning or execution

Resolution of these belongs to later phases.

---

## Exit Condition (Human Judgment)

Phase II ends only when a reviewer can say:

- “These representations remember reality faithfully.”
- “Nothing here tells a human what to think or do.”
- “Time, silence, and persistence are harder to ignore than to explain away.”

A lightweight adversarial audit is required.
