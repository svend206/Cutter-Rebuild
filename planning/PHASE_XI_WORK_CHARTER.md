# Phase XI — Implementation (Execution)

## Work Charter (Authoritative, Procedural-Only)

---

## 1. Governing Authority (Binding)

- boot/BOOT_CONTRACT.md
- constitution/** (all canons)
- boot/PROJECT_PHASE_CONSTITUTION.md (latest amended version)
- DIRECTORY.md
- integrator/INTEGRATOR_HOME.md

If any conflict exists, this charter is void and work must refuse.

This charter is authoritative but **non-executable**.
It does not authorize implementation beyond what Phase XI permits.

---

## 2. Phase XI Purpose (Verbatim-Aligned)

Phase XI authorizes implementation **only** as a realization of constraints defined in Phases VI–X.

Phase XI also authorizes constitutional amendments **only** when a named human explicitly requests the change and the amendment strengthens constraints or closes ambiguity without adding new authority.

---

## 3. Authorized Work

Phase XI allows:

- implementation **only** as a realization of constraints defined in Phases VI–X,
- constitutional amendments that strengthen constraints or close ambiguity without adding new authority, and that follow constitutional amendment ceremony and governance requirements,
- creation of the Phase XI required artifacts listed below,
- documentation necessary to make those artifacts reviewable.

Implementation is permitted **only** as realization of prior constraints.

---

## 4. Forbidden Work

Phase XI must not:

- perform selective implementation,
- imply guarantees not defined in Phase VII,
- introduce UX judgment, ranking, or evaluative framing,
- perform any Layer 2 work,
- redefine meaning, authority, or boundaries outside constitutional amendment ceremony,
- implement behavior not defined in earlier phases.

Any work that introduces new authority or judgment is invalid.

---

## 5. Required Artifacts (Verbatim List)

1. **Constraint Coverage Matrix (Authoritative)**
2. **Implementation Trace Map**
3. **Phase XI Adversarial Implementation Audit Record**

No other standalone artifacts are authorized in this phase, except constitutional amendment records and audits required by amendment ceremony.

---

## 6. Execution Order Constraint

No code, UI, infrastructure, or tooling may be created
until the Constraint Coverage Matrix exists and is reviewable.

---

## 7. Refusal Discipline

Work must refuse when:

- any Global Invariant is violated,
- scope exceeds Phase XI authorization,
- authority is unclear or missing,
- a known fix is deferred in violation of the No Known Deferral rule,
- a constitutional conflict exists.

Refusal is compliance.

---

## 8. Adversarial Posture

All Phase XI artifacts are written to be attacked by an adversarial reviewer.
They must be legible, testable, and structured for adversarial scrutiny.

---

STOP.
