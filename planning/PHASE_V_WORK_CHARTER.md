# Phase V — Work Charter (Reliance)

Phase: V — Reliance

Status: Active

---

## Intent (Locked)

Reliance is bounded, explicit, and never a substitute for human judgment.

---

## Purpose

Phase V defines the conditions under which humans may rely on the system
without surrendering judgment, authority, or responsibility.

Reliance boundaries are expressed through reports, which are the primary interface.

---

## Allowed Work (This Phase Only)

During Phase V, work may include:

- Defining the explicit promises the system makes to humans
- Defining what the system is safe to be relied upon for
- Defining what the system must never be relied upon for
- Defining how reliance boundaries are communicated clearly
- Defining how the system signals:
  - “this is complete”
  - “this is incomplete”
  - “this is absent”
  - “this is unresolved”
- Defining how humans acknowledge reliance explicitly
- Defining how responsibility remains human even when reliance occurs

---

## Forbidden Work

During Phase V, the project must not:

- Encourage deference to the system’s judgment
- Present the system as authoritative or final
- Imply correctness, safety, or completeness by default
- Hide uncertainty once reliance is possible
- Collapse human responsibility into system behavior
- Allow reliance to become automatic or unconscious

---

## Required Artifacts (to Exit Phase V)

Before Phase V can end, the following must exist:

- A clear statement of what reliance means
- A clear statement of where reliance stops
- A clear description of how uncertainty is still shown
- A clear description of how humans remain accountable
- A clear description of how misuse remains visible

---

## Exit Gate (Human Judgment, Adversarial)

Phase V may be exited only when a reviewer can say:

- “I know exactly what this system will not do.”
- “If I misuse this, I cannot blame the system.”
- “Reliance here increases responsibility, not comfort.”

A lightweight adversarial audit is required.

---

## Phase V Boundary Statement

Reliance is permitted only where boundaries are explicit,
and it ends wherever human responsibility would otherwise be obscured.
