# Phase II — Representation Invariants (Time, Absence, Linking, Inspection)

This document defines representation invariants only.
It does not prescribe behavior, workflows, or responses.

---

## 1) Time, Duration, and Sequence

**Time is a first-class fact.**  
Records include when they occurred or were declared.

**Ordering is preserved without interpretation.**  
Sequence must be representable without implying priority, importance, or meaning.

**Duration is preserved without evaluation.**  
Time-in-condition may be represented without thresholds, alerts, or judgment.

---

## 2) Absence and Non-Occurrence

**Absence is represented explicitly.**  
Non-occurrence is a recordable fact, not a default assumption.

**Absence does not imply safety, fault, or urgency.**  
Silence and non-occurrence carry no evaluation.

**Absence must never trigger action.**  
The record of absence is descriptive only.

---

## 3) Linking Without Collapse

**Reference relationships between records are representable only as “refers to.”**  
Links identify references without adding meaning.

**Links must not imply causality, hierarchy, aggregation, or summary.**  
A link does not explain or elevate any record.

**Linked records retain independent meaning.**  
Each record is preserved independently.

---

## 4) Inspection and Non-Collapsing

**Original records remain inspectable.**  
No representation may replace or obscure originals.

**Views, summaries, or projections are not records.**  
They must not be treated as authoritative records.

**No hidden collapsing or replacement of originals.**  
Any reduction must remain visible and reversible.
