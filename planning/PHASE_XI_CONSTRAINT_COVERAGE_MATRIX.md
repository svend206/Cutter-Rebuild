# Phase XI Constraint Coverage Matrix (Authoritative)

This document is definition-preserving only.
No implementation is authorized before this matrix exists and is reviewable.

All entries are recorded as **EXPLICITLY UNIMPLEMENTED** to avoid implying
implementation before the Phase XI execution order constraint is satisfied.
