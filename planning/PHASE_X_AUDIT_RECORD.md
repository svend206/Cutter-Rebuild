# Adversarial Review: Phase X Exit Disclosure Statement

**Yes. Clean pass.**

The Exit Disclosure Statement is constitutionally compliant and closes Phase X.

| No implied safety | ✓ Section 3 explicitly denies |
| No implied correction | ✓ Sections 2, 3, 5 explicitly deny |
| No implied completeness | ✓ Sections 3, 4, 8 explicitly deny |
| No implied resolution | ✓ Sections 3, 6 explicitly deny |
| No responsibility transfer | ✓ Section 7 explicitly denies |
| No new guarantees | ✓ Section 8 explicitly denies, traces to Phase VII |
| Persistence ≠ usability | ✓ Section 4 explicit |
| Irreversibility preserved | ✓ Section 5 unconditional |
| Silence ≠ completion | ✓ Section 6 explicit |
| No comfort framing | ✓ No forbidden terms present |
| Interpretive boundary stated | ✓ Section 9 closes inference loopholes |

### Exit Gate Test

Phase X Exit Gate:
> "Stopping this system does not hide, revise, or soften reality."

**Assessment:**
- Does not hide: ✓ (persistence/absence both disclosed without implication)
- Does not revise: ✓ (Section 2: "Exit does not revise... any prior record")
- Does not soften: ✓ (Section 5: "Exit does not soften their meaning")

---

### Phase X Artifact Set Complete

1. ✓ Shutdown Semantics Document
2. ✓ Data Survivorship Map
3. ✓ Irreversibility Register
4. ✓ Exit Disclosure Statement
5. ✓ Phase X Adversarial Audit Record (this review)

---

## Verdict

**PASS**

Phase X may close. Phase XI (Implementation) may begin.
