# Phase II — Record Types Catalogue (Representation Only)

This catalogue defines the kinds of records the system may hold in Phase II.
It is descriptive only. It does not assign meaning, priority, or response.

---

## 1) Action Record

**Purpose**  
Hold a durable statement that an action occurred.

**What it preserves**  
That something was done, as a fact.

**Does not mean**  
That the action was correct, useful, successful, or justified.

**Must never trigger**  
Any recommendation, escalation, or response.

---

## 2) Observation Record

**Purpose**  
Hold a durable statement that something was observed.

**What it preserves**  
That an observation was made, as a fact.

**Does not mean**  
That the observation is important, complete, or decisive.

**Must never trigger**  
Any recommendation, escalation, or response.

---

## 3) Declaration Record

**Purpose**  
Hold a durable statement that a human explicitly declared something to be true.

**What it preserves**  
That an explicit declaration was made.

**Does not mean**  
That the declaration is correct, permanent, or binding beyond its scope.

**Must never trigger**  
Any recommendation, escalation, or response.

---

## 4) Reaffirmation / Reclassification Record

**Purpose**  
Hold a durable statement that a prior declaration was either reaffirmed
or reclassified by a human.

**What it preserves**  
That continuity or change was explicitly declared.

**Does not mean**  
That the reaffirmation or reclassification is wise, timely, or final.

**Must never trigger**  
Any recommendation, escalation, or response.

---

## 5) Absence / Non-Occurrence Record

**Purpose**  
Hold a durable statement that something did not occur or did not arrive.

**What it preserves**  
That a non-occurrence was recorded as a fact.

**Does not mean**  
That the absence is acceptable, urgent, or alarming.

**Must never trigger**  
Any recommendation, escalation, or response.

---

## 6) Refusal Record

**Purpose**  
Hold a durable statement that a refusal occurred and an attempted action was not performed.

**What it preserves**

**Does not mean**  
That the request was wrong, unreasonable, or harmful.

**Must never trigger**  
Any recommendation, escalation, or response.

---

## 7) Reference / Link Record

**Purpose**  
Hold a durable statement that one record references another.

**What it preserves**  
That a relationship was recorded between records.

**Does not mean**  
That one record explains, justifies, or overrides another.

**Must never trigger**  
Any recommendation, escalation, or response.

## 8) Correction / Supersession Record

**Purpose**  
Hold a durable statement that one record is designated as superseding another.

**What it preserves**  
That a supersession designation was recorded without erasing history.

That the earlier record was erroneous, careless, invalid, or blameworthy.

**Must never trigger**  
Any recommendation, escalation, or response.
