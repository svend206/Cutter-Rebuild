# Phase I — Work Charter (Grounding)

Phase: I — Grounding

Status: Active

---

## Intent

Phase I exists to establish **epistemic safety before construction**.

The goal of this phase is to ensure that:
- authority is explicit,
- boundaries are unambiguous,
- forbidden moves are named,
- nothing implicit can later be mistaken for permission.

This phase deliberately avoids usefulness, design, and implementation.

---

## Allowed Work (This Phase Only)

During Phase I, work may include:

- Defining **conceptual boundaries** between:
  - action vs recognition
  - observation vs judgment
  - recording vs meaning

- Writing **hard exclusions**:
  - things this system will never do
  - roles this system will never play

- Naming **categories of things that may exist**
  (without defining their structure or behavior)

- Clarifying **who holds authority**, and where the system must stop

- Making **unknowns explicit** and leaving them unresolved

- Identifying **places where future phases will require discipline**
  (without solving them)

All outputs must be human-legible and non-technical.

---

## Forbidden Work

During Phase I, the project must not:

- Design systems, schemas, workflows, or interfaces
- Define representations, records, or data structures
- Invent features, capabilities, or user experiences
- Describe how anything will be implemented
- Encode success, failure, health, or quality
- Introduce metrics, scores, rankings, or indicators
- Suggest responses, actions, or optimizations
- Resolve uncertainty “for clarity”

If something sounds useful or actionable, it is probably out of scope.

---

## Required Outputs (to Exit Phase I)

Before Phase I can end, the following must exist:

- A written articulation of **what the system is allowed to know**
- A written articulation of **what the system must never decide**
- A clear boundary statement describing **where human authority begins**
- A durable list of **permanent exclusions**
- A visible list of **open questions** with no attempted resolution

---

## Known Unknowns (Intentionally Preserved)

The following are explicitly not to be resolved in Phase I:

- What exact records will exist
- How time or persistence will be represented
- What users will see or interact with
- How different parts of the system connect
- What later phases will choose to emphasize

Premature resolution here is a phase violation.

---

## Exit Condition (Human Judgment)

Phase I ends only when a reviewer can say:

- “Nothing here implies future behavior by accident.”
- “Authority boundaries are clear and hard to misuse.”
- “Unknowns are visible, not patched over.”

A lightweight adversarial audit is required.
