# Phase VIII — Abuse Visibility Boundary
## Loop 2 — Definition Only

### Section 1 — Scope and Non-Claims
This boundary assigns visibility status to each enumerated misuse pattern. It does not imply detection competence, completeness, representativeness, prevention, deterrence, safety, or harm reduction. Visibility is disclosure, not capability. Non-surfaced misuse remains possible. Surfaced misuse does not imply coverage.

### Section 2 — Visibility Classification Table
1. Misuse ID / Name: 1. What is misused: Input fields and payloads  
   Visibility Status: Not Surfaced  
   Basis for Visibility Decision: epistemic limit
2. Misuse ID / Name: 2. What is misused: Identifier references  
   Visibility Status: Not Surfaced  
   Basis for Visibility Decision: epistemic limit
3. Misuse ID / Name: 3. What is misused: Time fields  
   Visibility Status: Not Surfaced  
   Basis for Visibility Decision: epistemic limit
4. Misuse ID / Name: 4. What is misused: Sequence of entries  
   Visibility Status: Surfaced  
   Basis for Visibility Decision: architectural boundary
5. Misuse ID / Name: 5. What is misused: Record completeness  
   Visibility Status: Not Surfaced  
   Basis for Visibility Decision: epistemic limit
6. Misuse ID / Name: 6. What is misused: Evidence attachments  
   Visibility Status: Not Surfaced  
   Basis for Visibility Decision: epistemic limit
7. Misuse ID / Name: 7. What is misused: Evidence absence  
   Visibility Status: Surfaced  
   Basis for Visibility Decision: architectural boundary
8. Misuse ID / Name: 8. What is misused: Evidence substitution  
   Visibility Status: Surfaced  
   Basis for Visibility Decision: architectural boundary
9. Misuse ID / Name: 9. What is misused: Scope boundaries  
   Visibility Status: Not Surfaced  
   Basis for Visibility Decision: epistemic limit
10. Misuse ID / Name: 10. What is misused: Actor attribution  
    Visibility Status: Not Surfaced  
    Basis for Visibility Decision: epistemic limit
11. Misuse ID / Name: 11. What is misused: Consent indicators  
    Visibility Status: Surfaced  
    Basis for Visibility Decision: architectural boundary
12. Misuse ID / Name: 12. What is misused: State transitions  
    Visibility Status: Surfaced  
    Basis for Visibility Decision: architectural boundary
13. Misuse ID / Name: 13. What is misused: Outcome fields  
    Visibility Status: Surfaced  
    Basis for Visibility Decision: architectural boundary
14. Misuse ID / Name: 14. What is misused: Ownership assignment  
    Visibility Status: Surfaced  
    Basis for Visibility Decision: architectural boundary
15. Misuse ID / Name: 15. What is misused: Evidence timing  
    Visibility Status: Surfaced  
    Basis for Visibility Decision: architectural boundary
16. Misuse ID / Name: 16. What is misused: Access boundaries  
    Visibility Status: Not Surfaced  
    Basis for Visibility Decision: epistemic limit
17. Misuse ID / Name: 17. What is misused: Data export context  
    Visibility Status: Surfaced  
    Basis for Visibility Decision: architectural boundary
18. Misuse ID / Name: 18. What is misused: Aggregated summaries  
    Visibility Status: Surfaced  
    Basis for Visibility Decision: architectural boundary
19. Misuse ID / Name: 19. What is misused: Redaction choices  
    Visibility Status: Surfaced  
    Basis for Visibility Decision: architectural boundary
20. Misuse ID / Name: 20. What is misused: Duplicate records  
    Visibility Status: Surfaced  
    Basis for Visibility Decision: architectural boundary
21. Misuse ID / Name: 21. What is misused: Record linkage  
    Visibility Status: Surfaced  
    Basis for Visibility Decision: architectural boundary
22. Misuse ID / Name: 22. What is misused: Unclaimed responsibility  
    Visibility Status: Surfaced  
    Basis for Visibility Decision: architectural boundary
23. Misuse ID / Name: 23. What is misused: Delegated action records  
    Visibility Status: Not Surfaced  
    Basis for Visibility Decision: epistemic limit
24. Misuse ID / Name: 24. What is misused: Silence framing  
    Visibility Status: Surfaced  
    Basis for Visibility Decision: architectural boundary
25. Misuse ID / Name: 25. What is misused: Partial disclosure  
    Visibility Status: Surfaced  
    Basis for Visibility Decision: architectural boundary

### Section 3 — Explicit Blind-Spot Statement
Non-surfaced misuse remains possible. Lack of visibility does not imply rarity or safety. Surfaced misuse does not imply completeness.
