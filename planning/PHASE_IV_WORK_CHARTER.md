# Phase IV — Work Charter (Exposure)

Phase: IV — Exposure

Status: Active

---

## Intent

Phase IV exists to make bound reality **visible to humans**  
without introducing interpretation, judgment, or authority.

The goal of this phase is not understanding, insight, or action,
but **faithful exposure**.

Exposure must never become explanation.
Visibility must never become instruction.

---

## Allowed Work (This Phase Only)

During Phase IV, work may include:

- Defining how bound records are **presented to humans**
- Defining how **time, duration, and sequence** are made visible
- Defining how **absence and silence** are shown explicitly
- Defining how **refusals** are shown without softening
- Defining how **supersession and history** are shown without collapse
- Defining how humans may **inspect originals** and prior states
- Defining how deferred Phase III risks are addressed:
  - record volume / obscuring
  - practical human inspectability

All exposure must be:
- descriptive, not evaluative
- faithful, not optimized
- reversible at the presentation layer only

---

## Forbidden Work

During Phase IV, the project must not:

- Encode judgment, scoring, ranking, or evaluation
- Hide, summarize, or collapse records by default
- Treat silence as safety or success
- Treat supersession as erasure
- Introduce recommendations, alerts, or guidance
- Automate responses to what is shown
- Decide what a human *should* do
- Establish “normal,” “healthy,” or “acceptable” states

If exposure makes something feel “resolved,” it is wrong.

---

## Phase III Deferral Obligations (Mandatory)

Phase IV must explicitly address the following risks deferred from Phase III:

### 1) Record Volume and Obscuring

- Exposure must prevent large volumes of records from hiding individual records.
- Mitigations must not:
  - erase records
  - collapse history
  - silently filter content
- Any reduction must remain visible and reversible.

### 2) Human Inspectability and Accessibility

- Bound records must remain practically inspectable by humans.
- Exposure must not require specialized tooling, reconstruction, or expert intervention.
- Loss of accessibility is treated as loss of visibility, not convenience.

Phase IV may not be closed unless these obligations are addressed and audited.

---

## Required Outputs (to Exit Phase IV)

Before Phase IV can end, the following must exist:

- A clear description of **what is shown**
- A clear description of **what is intentionally not shown**
- A clear description of how **absence and silence** appear
- A clear description of how **history and supersession** appear
- A clear description of how **reductions or views remain reversible**
- A clear description of how deferred Phase III risks are mitigated

All outputs must avoid:
- interpretation
- explanation
- advice
- actionability

---

## Known Unknowns (Intentionally Preserved)

The following are explicitly not resolved in Phase IV:

- What actions humans should take
- What outcomes are good or bad
- What thresholds matter
- What decisions should be automated
- What constitutes success or failure

These belong to later phases.

---

## Exit Condition (Human Judgment)

Phase IV ends only when a reviewer can say:

- “I can see everything that matters.”
- “Nothing important is hidden by convenience.”
- “The system is not telling me what to think or do.”

A lightweight adversarial audit is required.
