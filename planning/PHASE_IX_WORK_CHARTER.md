# Phase IX — Commercialization Boundaries

## Work Charter (Authoritative, Definition-Only)

---

## 1. Authority and Scope

This Work Charter governs **all work performed in Phase IX**.

It derives authority from:

* the Constitution,
* the Project Phase Constitution,
* Phase VII (Guarantees & Claim Boundaries), and
* Phase VIII (Abuse & Adversarial Resistance).

If any conflict exists, **this charter is void** and work must refuse.

Phase IX is **definition-only**.
No implementation, sales execution, marketing execution, contracting, or tooling is authorized.

---

## 2. Purpose of Phase IX

Phase IX exists to define **how the system may be described, represented, demonstrated, sold, or contractually framed**
**without selling authority, judgment, correctness, protection, or safety**.

This phase constrains:

* language,
* representations,
* demonstrations,
* warranties,
* and omissions.

It does not optimize persuasion.
It prevents **over-claiming by implication**.

---

## 3. Binding Constraints (Inherited)

### 3.1 Zero-Guarantee Posture (from Phase VII)

* The system asserts **no guarantees**.
* Commercial language MUST NOT:

  * imply correctness, completeness, durability, availability, ordering, security, or safety,
  * imply detection or prevention of failure or abuse,
  * imply fitness for purpose,
  * imply harm reduction or protection.

Silence is not permission.
Any claim not explicitly allowed here is forbidden.

---

### 3.2 Abuse Visibility Non-Implication (from Phase VIII)

Commercial representations MUST NOT:

* imply that abuse visibility equals abuse detection,
* imply that surfaced misuse is representative,
* imply that non-surfaced misuse is rare or controlled,
* convert abuse visibility into a selling point.

Abuse disclosure is **epistemic honesty**, not product capability.

---

## 4. Allowed Work

During Phase IX, the project may **define and document** only the artifacts authorized by the Project Phase Constitution:

1. **Claim Consistency Check against Phase VII**

   * Verification that all commercial language is consistent with the zero-guarantee posture
   * May enumerate permitted statements only as a derived subsection, not as an independent claims surface

2. **Prohibited Claim List**

   * Binding list of forbidden explicit and implied claims (non-exhaustive)

3. **Demonstration Constraint Statement**

   * Binding limits on what demonstrations may and may not show
   * Requirements for visible refusal, uncertainty, and absence

All outputs must be **auditable, explicit, and hostile-reader-safe**.

---

## 5. Forbidden Work

Phase IX MUST NOT:

* invent new claims
* soften denied claims through marketing language
* re-introduce guarantees via analogy or metaphor
* use testimonials, examples, or case studies to imply outcomes
* imply customer success, protection, or safety
* imply suitability, readiness, or correctness
* rely on common industry norms to imply missing claims
* implement sales flows, pricing, contracts, or tooling

If a statement answers:

> "Why should I trust this system?"

it is invalid.

---

## 6. Language Discipline

### 6.1 Required Properties

All Phase IX language MUST:

* remain present-tense and factual
* describe constraints and refusals explicitly
* surface uncertainty without mitigation
* survive removal from context without becoming misleading

### 6.2 Forbidden Framing (Non-Exhaustive)

Language MUST NOT include:

* "ensures"
* "helps guarantee"
* "designed to prevent"
* "reduces risk"
* "improves safety"
* "trusted"
* "reliable"
* "enterprise-grade"
* "best-in-class"
* "robust"
* "secure"

No euphemisms.
No softeners.

---

## 7. Required Artifacts

Phase IX must produce **only** the artifacts explicitly authorized by the Project Phase Constitution:

1. **Claim Consistency Check against Phase VII**

   * Verification that all commercial language is consistent with the zero-guarantee posture
   * May enumerate permitted statements only as a derived subsection, not as an independent claims surface

2. **Prohibited Claim List**

   * Binding list of forbidden explicit and implied claims (non-exhaustive)

3. **Demonstration Constraint Statement**

   * Binding limits on what demonstrations may and may not show
   * Requirements for visible refusal, uncertainty, and absence

No other standalone artifacts are authorized in this phase.

---

## 8. Exit Gate

Phase IX may be exited only when a reviewer can truthfully say:

> "No commercial representation here introduces claims not present or denied in Phase VII."

If any reviewer can extract:

* implied correctness,
* implied safety,
* implied protection,
* implied competence,
* or implied authority transfer,

then Phase IX has failed and must be corrected.

---

## 9. Refusal Obligation

Any work that:

* exceeds this scope,
* introduces implication by analogy,
* or weakens the zero-guarantee posture

MUST be refused immediately.

Refusal is compliance.

---

## 10. Closure Rule

Phase IX closes only through:

* completed artifacts,
* explicit pass/fail determination,
* commit, tag, and push.

No conditional passes.
No partial exits.

---

STOP.
