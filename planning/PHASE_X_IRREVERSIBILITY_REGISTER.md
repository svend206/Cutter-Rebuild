# Phase X — Irreversibility Register

## 1. Scope and Non-Claims
This register enumerates irreversible actions and constraints on reversal. It does not imply safety, correctness, or completeness.

## 2. Irreversible Actions (Declarative)
- Recording of an irreversible record is not undone by shutdown.
- Historical meaning is not rewritten by exit.
- Absence of reversal options is explicit; reversal is not promised.

## 3. Non-Reversal Constraints
- No action is reversed by shutdown semantics.
- No record is softened or reframed at exit.
- Irreversibility is preserved regardless of ownership, scope, or convenience.
