# Phase VII — Work Charter (Abuse & Adversarial Resistance)

Phase: VII — Abuse & Adversarial Resistance  
Status: Draft

---

## Intent

Phase VII exists to define how misuse, coercion, and adversarial behavior
are **made visible rather than prevented, moralized, or denied**.

This phase does not create guarantees.

---

## Allowed Work (This Phase Only)

During Phase VII, the project may **define and document**:

- abuse and misuse scenarios,
- incentive and economic attack patterns,
- which abuse scenarios are surfaced explicitly,
- which abuse scenarios remain possible **without system-level visibility**, and
- explicit explanations for why visibility is not provided in those cases.

All distinctions must be descriptive, not evaluative.

---

## Forbidden Work

Phase VII must not:

- promise prevention or safety,
- classify intent,
- enforce morality,
- suppress uncomfortable usage,
- implement controls or mitigations.

---

## Required Artifacts (to Exit Phase VII)

- Adversarial Misuse Catalog  
- Abuse Visibility Boundary (Surfaced vs Not Surfaced, with explanation)  
- Residual Harm Disclosure  
- Phase VII Adversarial Audit Record  

---

## Exit Condition (Human Judgment)

Phase VII ends only when a reviewer can say:

> “If this is abused, the limits of visibility are explicit and not denied.”
